[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/20998/" title="A large pub holding a privileged position near the church, consisting apparently of two different sized buildings. The entrance is in the smaller building on the right, which holds the lounge bar and leads through to a beer garden of sorts, really no more than a yard. The larger public bar is to the left. In the lounge I saw two hand pumps, with clips for Everards Beacon Hill and Tiger, but when I asked for the latter, the server went through to the other bar to pour the beer. My half was in good nick and I took it through to the yard to consume. This seems like a friendly and welcoming pub and certainly one to include if doing a circuit of Melton." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/21005/" title="Strange that the Half Moon\'s inn sign depicts a crescent moon, which is of course less than half. Whatever, this building looks like an old coaching inn with more than half now used for purposes other than the consumption of alcohol. In fact, what is left would be a similar proportion to a crescent moon. A fairly small front bar and a room behind with a much smaller bar counter, plus a pool table, darts board and gaming machines. The front bar has two hand pumps, serving Bass and Marstons EPA. I went for the Bass, which was deceptively fresh and a nice change after the dreadful beer I\'d suffered in the nearby BeerHeadZ. However, it soon became apparent that the glass was a little smelly and the beer had a faint banana-ish flavour. Oh dear." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
