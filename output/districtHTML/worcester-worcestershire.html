[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/64464/" title="This was my favorite pub on our short visit to Worcester , the bar is up some stairs from the entrance with a room either side , the room on the right leads to the small beer garden and outside toilets , there is a small standing only area at the bar front , home to the chatty , friendly and eccentric locals who made us  feel very welcome .
Beers on the 5 handpulls were Backyard East India , Hobsons Best , Maldon Mighty Oak , Maldon Gold and Malvern Green Pear which was lovely .
We only intended to stay for a quick pint but the rainy night and warm friendly welcome meant we wobbled out several hours later ." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
