[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/85502/" title="Having been to the Hairy Dog and the Dog & Moon in Derby the day before our visit to Sutton, and with the Scruffy Dog still to come, perhaps I was getting a little tired of dogs. Actually, the reason I didn\'t enjoy my visit here was not the fault of the pub but of my footwear, which the ice and slush had exposed as being not as waterproof as I had supposed when setting out. I had to make a couple of emergency purchases (boots and socks) in the local shops and settled down here (with a beer) to change into them. The result was a failure to appreciate what a nice job has been made of this shop conversion. The large front room with the bar counter on the right is supplemented by the small room, with fake fire and some comfortable chairs, off the corridor to the toilets at the rear. I went for the Exmoor Exmas 5% (see photo for other beers), though because of being focused on my feet at the time, I\'m unable to say how good this beer was - I\'m sure my notes would have said if it was anything other than good. One to return to, I think.

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/31249/" title="I visited the Masons as part of a crawl of Sutton with one of my regular drinking companions, and this was the fifth pub, or sixth if you count the Sheffield Tap before boarding our train, so my notes were becoming increasingly sketchy. Beers on tap were Shepherd Neame Spitfire and Bradfield Steel Cow, and there was also a perry rather than a cider. We propped up the bar in the darts room, which has three darts boards and is set up for competitions. It was fairly quiet here at the time of our visit, and I see from WhatPub that the Masons closed seven months later and is for sale.
