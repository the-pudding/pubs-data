[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/86757/" title="A true micropub, with no room to swing a cat and not much for lifting your beer glass once eight or nine people make it through the door. So it was surprising to see six hand pumps here - in fact, I was surprised to see a pub here at all, having not planned to be in Belper and finding the pub there as I stepped off the bus intending to catch a train to Derby. I asked the owner how he got on with that many real ales in such a small space - he said they use some pins as well as firkins, and sell beer on Sundays (open just 1 to 5) at £2.50 per pint, with Monday being closed, and this way any wastage is minimal. My half of Silver Street Ruby 4.7% was spot on, as was the Old Sawley Jobber 4.2% when I accidentally returned here a few days later with a couple of friends, our plans having been scuppered by the strike on Northern Trains so that we ended up on this East Midlands line instead." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/84286/" title="Having missed an opportunity for a drink here a few weeks before, when I passed through Duffield some hours before opening time, a quick look at the bus timetable when in Darley Abbey showed me a window of opportunity. The next bus going to Belper would drop me off near the pub some 13 minutes before the next one going south would take me back to Derby. So this review is based on the briefest of acquaintances, but I must say I was quietly impressed. As both Alan and Ray have observed, this is a pub without a bar counter, the beers and ciders being listed on blackboards on both sides of a beam across the middle of the shop. Service was very prompt and the beer was in delightful condition. The cold room where the beers are stillaged is visible when following the signs to the toilet, and there were clearly a lot of beers waiting to come on (with, I think, four or five listed as available). There\'s a real fire and a friendly sort of atmosphere - there were about 10 other drinkers already here when I arrived 10 minutes after opening time. For those who like that sort of thing, there were pork pies and scotch eggs available, and bowls of water for canine companions. Obviously a well used and well loved pub. I\'ll be back for a more leisurely visit.
