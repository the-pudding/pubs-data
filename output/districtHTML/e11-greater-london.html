As described below a fantastic two bar traditional back street local hidden down Browning road a short distance from the noise and bustle of Leytonstone High Street, that is keeping a pace with modern times.
Still retaining two rooms that are marked public and saloon by the etched glass windows in the doors the one marked public is actually the more comfortable, being wider and with more seating that the saloon. But it does have the dart board in this section and there is a serving hatch through to the main bar which is in the Saloon room. I naturally gravitated to the Saloon side which is where the beer pumps are, but this is actually the thinner and plainer side of the pub having only one table in the window and some bar stools up the bar and along the beer shelf on the far wall decorated with various steam engine pictures.
Five of the six ale pumps were in operation for my visit and alongside the regular beers of Oakham Ale JHB and ELB Foundation Bitter the three guests were Northdown Brewery He-Bru IPA, TT Boltmaker and Redemption Trinity. I went for the Redemption brew and very good it was too and at £3.90 a pint. And then the Craft Keg unit at the end of the bar had two ELB craft beers and two from Bevertown.
There is indeed a Thai food menu served in the evenings, as indicated on the chalk board menu at the end of the saloon bar and people were still tucking into it during my visit despite the lateness of the hour. A good thing was that the Thai food smell did not pervade through the pub like I have experienced in other pubs with a Thai kitchen. I noted the food hours from the chalk board to be 6 to 9.45PM Tue to Friday and 3 to 9PM at the weekends." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/55967/" title="I think its safe to say I don’t think I am the target demographic for this one. I popped in for a quick one on a Wednesday evening when their pub quiz was in full flow and the guy running it behind the DJ deck had a brightly coloured hair extension that would not have been out of place in Sigue Sigue Sputnik and I would have probably raised the average age of any of the teams attending by at least 10, and how they were writing the answers down was a bit of a mystery as I had trouble seeing my way to the bar.
But when you get there the beer choice is not too bad. The same two Five Points Cask Ales as mentioned below and the Railway porter was rather good. And then as well as standard draft tap units on the bar there is a tiled craft tap wall with eight taps at the back of the bar. These were dominated by Laines brews but I also saw ones from Signature Brew, Fourpure, Hackney Brewery and Five Points. 
Very well described by previous reviewers I didn’t see any table tennis table but then it could have been taken out for the quiz or covered over for use as a table. And I don’t think the wall art is meant to be David Beckham. 
If I ever experience a “Self/Less” moment and transfer myself into the body of a 30 year old vegan I could find myself back here.  Otherwise you’ll find me in the North Star when I am back in the area." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
