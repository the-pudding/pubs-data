[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/70745/" title="Compared to the old horse and jockey anything will be classed as in improvement. now under the ownership of Heiniken and its star pubs brand, the old jockey has seen a complete renovation. now one large open plan room with trendy decor and wooden floors this is now a very nice place to be. 

On the beer front only the two real ale, Duchars IPA and a house ale called eagles ale but to me this was very much like Edinburgh castle (the old Caledonia 80) but i digress. the ducahrs was kept in a very fresh condition. 

Overall a massive improvement from the former pub, not my ideal place, i prefer the coffee grinder/robin hood and little john types, too many TVs and modern things for my liking  but if in Arnold and hovering around i would defiantly pop in for one seeing as they sell ale and good quality ale at that." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
