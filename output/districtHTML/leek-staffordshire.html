There are some nice touches here including the real fireplaces and the atmosphere is friendly and gentle.
Beers on were Facers North Star Porter, Bass, Springhead Outlawed, Thornbridge Jaipur IPA, Falstaff Cassius Mild, St Austell Tribute and Salopian Oracle. One hand pump was being changed and there were two ciders on.
Not at all a bad selection and I thoroughly enjoyed the Jaipur IPA but it didn\'t quite come up to the Earl Grey\'s level.
Another of Leek\'s gems." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/34376/" title="A very traditional boozer,the front door leads directly to the bar with it\'s array of 10 handpumps.To both sides of the servery there are impressive fireplaces with beautifully polished walnut surrounds,there is lots of quality ephemera and good looking and comfortable seating of different kinds.There is a rear snug,a darts board,flatscreens that were off on my visit and a walled beer garden.The landlord was drinking with the regulars around the bar and was a very engaging fellow, full of good advice on both beer and the local drinking scene.
There were two ciders,and a mix of real ales with some national brands and  some small brewers output.Thornbridge Jaipur was the high ABV option,with quite a few more modest strength beers and my Facers North Star Porter was well kept if a little predictable.
There is a strong community feel here and all women groups were in evidence given the calm atmosphere.Maybe not quite at the top of Leek\'s real ale scene,as a local boozer it\'s a very comfortable place to sink a pint or two." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
