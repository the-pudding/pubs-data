[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/84460/" title="This is a tiny little shop unit hidden away in the depths of Tooting Broadway Market, operating essentially as a bottle shop, but with a few draught options which you can drink in. The miniscule tiled floored shop space has a single table with two chairs under the front window, large shelves displaying bottled and canned beer to the left and a seat-less drinking ledge to the right which was all but lost under a deluge of boxes, kegs and other such beer-related paraphernalia. A small servery to the rear has a basic counter with a tatty old map tacked to the front and a whitewashed wall bar back lined with fridges and more shelves full of beer. Lots of old keg badges line the bar back whilst the little wall space through the rest of the room has been covered with a range of beer and Tooting themed bits and bobs, plus some ‘Craft Tooting’ merchandise. A couple more tables and chairs are available outside the unit and as this is a covered market, that’s essentially as good as being inside the unit itself in terms of warmth and shelter. A good soundtrack was playing throughout my visit, during which numerous customers came and went but we were the only ones who actually stopped by for a drink.
There were three craft keg options on draught as well as a vast array of bottles and cans to pick from on the shelves, all of which can be enjoyed on site if required. I tried the Wylam Jakehead, which was a nice, tasty brew, if a little cloudy, and the other half opted for a fruit beer from Tiny Rebel, which was too sour for my liking, although she seemed quite happy with it. The staff here were friendly and industrious, giving recommendations to punters and sorting through vast amounts of newly arrived products, which might have explained some of the clutter in the pub.
I seem to be encountering more and more places like this around London these days and find them very difficult to rate as their primarily bottle shops rather than bars. This one seemed like a middle of the road sort of place on the ‘pub’ front, with a limited draught selection, cramped confines but friendly staff and a buzzy feel. Worth a look if you’re traipsing around the market but Tooting has better pubs a short distance away." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/65470/" title="This imposing Victorian pub on the busy crossroads opposite Tooting Bec station is currently part of the Antic chain, although it is worth noting that the pub is under serious threat of closure, with locals and action groups such as CAMRA campaigning to keep it from being demolished or subject to the dreaded change of use to housing and retail space. It certainly seems like the sort of successful pub enterprise that is worthy of saving and a Sunday lunchtime visit suggested that it\'s pretty popular. The pub has clearly been altered a great deal over the years, so that little of the Victorian splendour remains, but Antic have done a decent enough job in making it feel like the sort of place you\'d happily relax in. The main bar area is bare boarded, with a curved servery along the middle of the back wall. Two rows of tables and chairs fill the space between the bar and the front windows, where a few button backed armchairs are positioned to allow you to snoop on drivers stopped at the adjacent traffic lights. To the right there are more comfy armchairs and sofas, some bookshelves, a TV screen which remained turned off during this visit and what I took to be an elaborate bit of original signage above the Ladies toilet door. A pile of board games was stacked up on a shelf opposite the bar, underneath a wall decorated with a lot of small family portraits. A lovely decorative archway leads through to a left hand side room with slightly quirkier Antic-style décor, including bright wallpaper, lots of different shaped mirrors and an old mangle, whilst a smart fireplace stands on the end wall. There are additional seating options here and even more can be found through a door to the rear, with a grand pediment above, which takes you into a large room which was being used for a lunchtime jazz performance on this visit. I didn\'t get to explore this room properly, but noticed some antlers on the wall and another fireplace. A garden can be accessed from the door to the rear of this room. A trip to the gents found a load of framed \'Wizard of Oz\' memorabilia on show - the link to the pub not being apparent to me.
I believe there are seven handpulls, although three were out of action when we arrived. Those still going offered up a rather strange selection of low strength bitters - Twickenham Grandstand (3.8%), Otter Bitter (3.6%), Sharp\'s Cornish Coaster (3.6%) and Exmoor Ale (3.8%). Not much variety there, but the Grandstand was at least in good nick and tasty enough. At least one real cider and one real perry were available, although there appeared to be more cider boxes behind the bar. We grabbed a bite to eat, with the roast beef being spot on and a generous portion size.
I thought that this was a pretty good pub with plenty going for it and the sort of place that the locals would do well to fight for. I enjoyed a lazy couple of hours here and had the beer range been a bit wider in scope, as I suspect it normally is, I might well have stayed longer. Lets hope the developers don\'t get their way with this one." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
