[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/41706/" title="A surprisingly good roadside pub which is relatively unspoiled given its location on a busy tourist route.  There is a good sized car park away from the road, the garden is well maintained and a pleasant place to sit, and there is a paved terrace at the front.  Inside has been partly opened out and decorated in a jolly style.  There is a comfy bar seating area with a brick fireplace, sofas and armchairs, plus a couple of large TV screens.  There is a large dining area with a carvery, and a smaller, more traditional dining area.  Food looked like better value for money than many other nearby pubs.  The atmosphere was calm and pleasant, and there was agreeable background music playing.  Ales on were Flack’s Double Drop and Romsey Gold, both in above-average condition.  I’d be very happy to come back in anytime I’m passing." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/41712/" title="A fairly traditional local. Staple shaped bar with a room of little distinction off the side. Low and bowed tongue and grooved wood ceiling, assumed to be a 1970s refurb job and overall has a bit of character. Pervading smell of old fags, a burberry style carpet and general lack of natural light didn’t enhance the ambience though. Rear courtyard patio and grassed garden looked decent. Five ales on, probably two too many; Abbott, Belhaven, Stonehenge Great Bustard and two from Twisted Ale. My half of the Twsited Pale was clearly the first out for a fair while but ostensibly fine (NBSS 2). Got a thanks from the locals and barmaid for visiting as I exited, so a point for friendliness that you rarely get in pubs nowadays." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
