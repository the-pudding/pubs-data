The only downside to that is the road down to it. I am sure I have seen it featured \"worlds most dangerous roads\"! Not much wider than the car it heads steeply down to the pub with no passing places. You can\'t see the car park and it looks as though you are driving in to the river! God only knows how bad it gets on a busy summers day?
The pub itself is decent but a little dirty (probably due to how busy it was). 3 beers from Wye Valley on - HPA, Butty Bach and another I didn\'t note. The HPA was just OK. To be honest I was thinking of the drive back up the road out! The advice from a local was \"just keep your foot down\"!
Next time I will use the ferry which was worth watching! You have been warned!" class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

      <p>Large pub and hotel near (as the name suggests!) the River Wye. 3 beers on - Ringwood 49er, Wye Valley Butty Bach and Lost Fossil. I went for the fossil and it was fine. We ate here and the food was very good. Happy to call again.</p>
