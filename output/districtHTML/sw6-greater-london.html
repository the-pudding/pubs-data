[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/23234/" title="A quick visit after a long while to try and find a particular bottled beer they claim to stock. After asking at the bar (‘not heard of it’) we then found a printed menu, new and crisp, which listed it. Taking it back to the bar resulted in a half-arsed search (and it wasn’t like they were busy at this point, three staff sat around doing nowt) which drew a predictable blank and no faint apology as to having something listed as available that they clearly haven’t had in for some time. Anyway on a baking hot day I decided to try one of the plethora of ales - Saltaire Titus - which was a real let-down (NBSS 2) and given the complete lack of any ale being sold, perhaps this was no surprise but even so, no effort to maintain freshness was disappointing. A new (for me) feature spotted was an ostentatious tank of Pilsner Urquell which I decided would be a better bet and it was. Left feeling that this place has let its previous high standards drop quite badly. Shame.

November 2011
Revisited the Sloany Pony for their annual Old Ales festival. Some fantastic choices and the pub is as good as I remembered last time. John Stapleton propping up the bar at the far end, so minor celebrity customers too. Rated 9

Sept 2009
The ‘Sloany Pony’ is a long-established ale haven, located in a cosy corner of Parsons Green. It’s quite a striking Victorian edifice, though the interior has been largely stripped out. There are six real ales, with Harveys Best seemingly a guest with the others changing frequently. There’s also an impressive array of posh keg beer (Sierra Nevada), bottled beers from around the world, ciders and wine; more than enough to keep the discerning punter happy. Prices can be quite variable; the Harveys is cheaper than you’d find in most other London ale outlets but the more unusual brews can be relatively expensive; ask before you order is my advice (especially with the keg stuff). The quality, however, is always top-notch. There’s a nice outside terrace that is popular, a nice place to watch the world go by. Inevitably a word about the punters – yes, they are often quite amusingly stereotypes but most are harmless and often provide unintentional entertainment. Staff are friendly and well-versed in the wares the pub sells. There are specialized beer festivals throughout the year but also expect to see specialized prices as well – at least they can justify them given the excellent sourcing of unusual brews. Gets very busy whenever Fulham or Chelsea are at home. Overall, this is a ‘must-do’ London pub, easily in the capital’s top 10. Rated 9" class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
