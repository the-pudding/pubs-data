[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/63053/" title="Large \'L\'-shaped \'spoons named after the Hollywood star nearby before emigrating to America with his family.  Housed in one corner of the large modern Dunstable Centre development (with BBC Three Counties and the Grove Theatre as neighbours), this has a towering ceiling and full-height windows so feels light and airy.  Some external tables can also be found overlooking the Grove House Gardens.  Not much doing on the two banks of five handpumps, with the Cairngorm Trade Winds (just £1.89 on a Monday) being about the best of three beers and a cider as alternatives to the trio of Ruddles, Doom Bar and Abbot." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

Run by Banks & Taylor, although I couldn\'t see any of its beers on the eight of 12 operational handpumps.  Having said that, the choice of guest ales in a range of styles was excellent, with a couple from Mallinson\'s and others from smaller breweries elsewhere around the country (e.g. Massey\'s Golden Bitter from the Heritage Brewing Company in Burton, £3.50).  Also has a draught cider and a range of bottled beers (examples of which are on display around the bar, along with a fine display of pump clips and other breweriana)." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
