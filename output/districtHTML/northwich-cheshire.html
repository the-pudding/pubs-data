[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/65812/" title="A very charming old building ,timber framed and in local brick,there is a barn conversion to the rear offering accomodation.The interior is traditional with a nesting of rooms off a central corridor.A large restaurant in two sections is followed by a discrete two table dining snug,while the tap room at the end is very authentic with a low ceiling,leather bound bench seating,a darts board,fireplace and small bar access.The servery is a small alcove off the corridor and had two real ales,Castle Rock Harvest Pale (in very good nick) and Wickwar Sundowner.Shame that both were similar low strength beers,a more varied selection would have gained more points for this timeless country pub where there is no muzak,screens or other modern distractions.
Pop in if passing,it\'s 10 minutes uphill from the Trent & Mersey along a busy road." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
