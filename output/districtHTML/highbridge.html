[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/32998/" title="Blackthorn gives an excellent description of the interior, below, which is a nice surprise given the rather shabby-looking exterior due mainly to its situation by the main road.  There is a car park at the back which it shares with neighbouring properties, and there is a children’s play area, past which you walk to gain access via a scruffy-looking back yard which doubles as a smoking area.  It’s very nice inside though, comfortable and airy, and there is a warm welcome from the staff, although the two pub dogs – an almost-matching pair of obese white labradors – were somewhat indifferent.  Food is good, better-than-average pub grub, slightly high-priced,  but freshly cooked and enjoyable. There were two ales on, Cheddar’s Buddle Pit and Butcombe Original, both in very good condition.  A decent place to stop for lunch or a few beers." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/33001/" title="A village pub as described by Blackthorn, below, and as he says, it’s dated.  Food is basic pub grub, served with a smile, but it’s lt down by its ale which is both poorly kept and over-priced – about 15% dearer than similar nearby pubs.  The ales on were Bath Gem and London Pride, both rather vinegary and only just drinkable.  There was another handpump with Thather’s Cider, and one which was dry.  We found the staff were friendly, but maybe just a bit too much so, almost Stepford in their manner.  It’s not a pub to which I warmed, and the beer price and quality mean I am unlikely to rush back.  It’s on the 2018 Somerset Ale Trail." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
