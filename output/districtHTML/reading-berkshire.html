Reading&rsquo;s newest pub &ndash; a large new-build aircraft... [<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/83870/" title="Refurbed and now called the Victoria Cross rather than the Trooper Potts - presumably because the Greene King suits didn\'t approve of the \'Pooper Trotts\' nickname coined by the locals.

September 2016
Reading’s newest pub – a large new-build aircraft hanger Greene King outlet and named in honour of the town\'s only Victoria Cross holder. The main large left front facing bar is for the cheap, deep-fried no-frills family dining experience and has an upper mezzanine level affording breathtaking views of the car park the Basingstoke Road. To the right through a door is a second smaller (but still sizeable ) over 18s bar with TV sports. Five pumps, four on; GK IPA, OSH, Abbot and Robinson Dizzy Blonde, the latter of which was gratifyingly cheap for Reading at just over 3 quid a pint and drank well enough. Punters less challenging than expected. Overall, it\'s better than I expected though I doubt I\'ll feel the need to revisit any time soon." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
