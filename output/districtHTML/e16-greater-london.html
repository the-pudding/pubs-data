Like its partner at the other end, which is now called Galyons Bar & Kichen, this old Grade II Listed building is a lone survivor among all the modern buildings around it. It\'s a hotel, so it\'s no surprise the bar area looks like what it is - a hotel lounge, and it looks very corporate with all the staff wearing black. There\'s an exposed brick archway, which would at one time have provided a more than decorative separation between drinking/dining areas. It has plenty of outside drinking space, but it can get a bit noisy out there as it\'s surrounded by busy roads, the DLR, and is underneath the London City Airport flightpath.

Moving back inside, two of the three handpumps had Oliver\'s Island and London Pride clips reversed, leaving only Bombardier available. A half of Bombardier and a smallish bottle of sparkling water was £5.10. I rarely buy sparkling water, and hadn\'t realised it was so expensive. There are glossy pub grub menus around - but unsurprisingly not cheap, with, for example, a burger and chips at £12.50. 

They\'ve managed to achieve the cheap hotel lounge look. But there\'s no other pub anywhere nearby, so it\'s obviously good that this one\'s a survivor." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87835/" title="It\'s unusual that a pub that was built in 1881, and is still functioning as a pub, was not on the site until now. It was originally called the Galleons Hotel, and is one of a trio of pubs built in the 1880s for the London and St Katharine Docks Company at the Royal Victoria and Albert Docks. The Connaught (now the Fox@Connaught) still survives down at the other end of the docks, but the Ship has gone. Being Grade II* Listed will have helped the building survive, although the Listing unfortunately didn\'t save the original fittings inside from being stripped out at some stage. It now appears as a lone survivor of a bygone age surrounded by very modern and taller buildings, probably containing unaffordable housing. The exterior still boasts a magnificent frieze of nymphs and the like - I always say that nymphs will invariably improve any pub. It originally had entrances on two levels, with what might be regarded as the upper class saloon bar on the upper level, and the public bar appropriately on the lower level. There was also an entrance that led directly out to the platform of the adjoining train station.

But the interior no way matches the exuberance of the exterior, looking like what it is - a hotel lounge. There\'s no real ale of course, the best bet being keg Meantime Pale Ale. They do food from 9 to 9; main courses are all £12 (e.g. beer battered haddock, chips, peas and tartare sauce) apart from the Black Angus steak at £21. Bar snacks (e.g. sausage roll, Scotch egg) are £4. The furnishings are what you would expect in a hotel lounge - mainly comfortable fixed bench seating but with some normal tables and chairs. There was a separate room on the right, which was being set up as a cinema when I was in on Wednesday early evening - and I wasn\'t certain whether this room would normally be available to drinkers. There\'s also some bench seating at the front.

It\'s a shame that such a magnificent old building now has such a nondescript bar, and is totally surrounded by modern developments. But at least it\'s still here. I\'ll give it a six for the building\'s architecture, and not for the bar or drinks." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
