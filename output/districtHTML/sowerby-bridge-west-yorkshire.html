[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/83560/" title="This looks like a big imposing pub on the outside, but once you step inside you realise the available space is actually smaller than it looks.  There is a room to the left with a pool table, the bar is straight ahead, and general seating in front of the windows to the right hand side of the pub.

At the bar were four hand pulls, two of which were off, the remaining offering Stod Fold Mandarina Bavaria and Stod Fold Gold.  The Mandarina Bavaria was apparently unavailable so that then reduced the selection to one.  The Gold was fine, however.

It looks like it may be quite an old pub, with several original features noted though it does have a modern feel overall.

I do feel the place would benefit from a bit more seating as the ever expanding party next to us did leave us feeling a little squashed.

We didn\'t investigate the Sowerby Taps bar downstairs (which as far as I can gather is part of the same establishment) so perhaps next time we are in Sowerby Bridge we may see how that compares to the main bar upstairs." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
