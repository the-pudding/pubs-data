The bar area is a fairly cramped space with the sort of exposed floor... [<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/35618/" title="This multiple room rural pub on the fringes of the village of Newdigate has an excellent reputation for its real ale and attracts a good crowd despite its tricky to reach location. The bar area is a fairly cramped space with the sort of exposed floorboards and nice ceiling beams you’d expect from a proper country pub. A short section of servery with a very handy beer board next to it results in a bit of a pinch point at peak times, but seating here has been kept to a minimum which means there’s enough space in which to patiently await your turn to be served. Over to the left, a wide but shallow room has plenty of tables and chairs which appeared to be set up predominantly for diners and was a little lacking in atmosphere comparted to the rest of the pub. To the right of the bar, there is a nice open space acting as a Public Bar of sorts with its own access to the servery and a roaring fire giving it a comforting warmth and homeliness, despite the relative lack of seating options. The low ceiling here was liberally covered with old pump clips attesting to the pub’s commitment to real ale over the years. Over in the front right part of the building, there are two further rooms, both set up as seating areas but both popular with those wanting to eat. Both rooms are carpeted and have plenty of tables and chairs, a nice balance of traditional and modern artworks on show, display cases full of glass and ceramic works, tonnes of CAMRA awards and certificates and more dark beams crossing the ceilings. There’s a large garden out the back, packed full of picnic tables and a good-sized car park which is most welcome given the difficulties getting here by public transport.
The bar was well stocked with cask ale as well as a surprisingly relevant craft keg selection and a few interesting bottles in the fridges. Cask options on this occasion were Surrey Hills Ranmore and Shere Drop, Pig & Porter Blonde, Northern Monk Striding Edge, Dark Star Revelation and Titanic Plum Porter. My pint of the Blonde was in fine shape and served to me by a very friendly barman. Plenty of people were eating throughout the pub, from a menu that had many tempting dishes, yet the pub in no way felt like it was food-led.
This is a top-quality pub which is well deserving of its excellent reputation. We found the pub had an excellent atmosphere, a well-kept selection of real ales, very good service and plenty of comfortable spots in which you could easily lose several hours. I’m glad I finally made it out to this place and would suggest it’s well worth the effort trying to get out here." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
