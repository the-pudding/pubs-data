[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/22702/" title="This is a spacious, open-plan back street, corner pub with a classic working class name and a decidedly more upmarket clientele. The front part of the pub comprises a large open space with large windows down two sides and two entrances. One porch, liberally draped with all sorts of greenery, leads out to a small front pavement seating area. The room is bare boarded and has lots of standard tables and chairs throughout, with a few plush armchairs and sofas over to the right hand side. The servery spans the rear wall and has a basic dark wood counter and an interesting bar back with a bright mosaic tile design depicting palm trees, for no apparent reason. Decor is fairly limited and what has been added is fairly uninspiring, with blackboards, plain mirrors and a very limited number of framed pictures providing the only forms of visual distraction. To the right of the bar, a lit fireplace was a nice focal point for those who’d just arrived on this chilly Autumn evening, whilst to the left, the room extends a way to the rear, where you’ll find a small space with a drinking ledge down one side and a couple of booths along the other – it’s a fairly dark and unwelcoming spot, but seemed popular enough on a busy midweek evening. The pub appeared to be packed with poseur types but a few students and tourists appeared over time and I ended up chatting endlessly to an American couple who were super-enthusiastic about all the pubs they’d been to in London – apart from this one!!
Four ales must qualify as an unexpectedly decent return for a pub like this, with customers given a choice of Black Sheep Holy Grail, Sharps Doom Bar, Taylor Landlord and Rudgate Hop For Heroes. I tried a pint of the latter and thought it was rather nice, which was a relief, as upon ordering, the barmaid somehow managed to smash a half pint glass that was trapped inside a pint glass, which she then used to serve my pint!
This place felt a bit like it was trying to be a refined, high-end pub suited to the locals, but fell a fair way short of achieving this, leaving us with a slightly pretentious feeling pub with nothing particularly marking it out from other such places in the area. I was happy enough here, chatting to my new American friends over a decent pint, but nothing here really grabbed me and made me want to rush back." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/22706/" title="This is a compact Nicholson’s pub on a street corner a short walk from High Street Kensington tube station. Arriving in the evening, the first thing I noticed was how dark the pub was, as you enter into a dimly lit room that combines with a great deal of dark wood panelling and floorboards, to create an atmospheric and rather cosy effect. A couple of long, padded, curved banquettes stand either side of the entrance with numerous low stools in support and two drinking ledge lined pillars opposite help to funnel people through the room, towards the bar area. The servery has a nice, U-shaped dark wood counter which arcs around the rear wall, beneath a smart canopy and pot shelf. Gleaming brass foot rails and an impressive back-lit Charringtons branded bar back add to the grand effect the servery produces, making it the main focal point of the room. Beyond the bar, there is a small space to the rear with limited seating and plenty more wood panels, but this seemed a bit cut-off from the rest ofg the pub and was proportionately quieter as a result. Decor throughout the pub includes various paintings, corporate-style blackboards and display cabinets full of random shiny things. There was also a framed front page of the Evening Standard from the day that John Lennon was shot, although this was partially lost beneath a load of tasteless Halloween decorations. There are a few pavement seats in a small front garden area  and a door to the rear leads out to a rear patio, which I failed to explore.
On the bar, the usual decent selection of ales you’d associate with Nicholson’s pubs were available, with the full range comprising Siren Liquid Mistress and Sweet Dream, Fullers London Pride, Nicholson’s Pale Ale, Sharps Doom bar and Wychwood Hobgoblin. The Sweet Dream set me back a hefty £5.05 for a pint but it was absolutely divine – one of the best beers I had all year and therefore almost worth the annoyingly large pile of shrapnel I got back in change.
I thought this was a good Nicholson’s pub with a nice, atmospheric interior, friendly bar staff and some heavenly beer, albeit at hellish prices. A lot of the pubs in this part of town make me feel a bit out of place, but I was more than happy sat in here and will be making it my ‘go to’ pub whenever I find myself in the area." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
