The pub was quiet on a Saturday night. it was very brightly lit and attracted just older locals. The other pubs on the road with more subdued lighting were fuller with the younger end of the market.
The only cask ale on was Stonehouse Station Bitter, which was below average. Not surprising as my half was the only one sold during my visit." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
