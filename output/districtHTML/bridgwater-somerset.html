[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/32824/" title="A backstreet boozer on the corner of a Victorian terrace, this pub has recently re-opened after a prolonged period of closure and trouble.  It consists of a single bar formed from knocking through the two front rooms, and a small garden at the back.  There is a pool table, dartboard, tv screen over a hamstone fireplace, a jukebox and various gaming machines.  The landlord was friendly enough, but I wouldn\'t want to upset him, while the locals seemed like an average bunch.  Three handpumps on the bar, but only one in service, dispensing Doombar which was in drinkable condition but could have been better kept.  I might drop in for a pint some time, especially given its location near the station, but it\'s not really a destination of choice and the beer precludes inclusion on a crawl.  It also doesn\'t open lunchtimes in the week." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/32828/" title="A great town pub rescued from closure and now providing a welcoming local and a decent watering hole.  It sits on a a pedestrianised side road off the High Street and has a view over the river at the front.  The single bar is basic yet comfortable, plenty of seating and circulation space.  Ales on draft were Ruby and Stout Hearted from Yeovil, BOB from Warwick, 3D’s Moulin Rouge and Who’s Ruffled Feathers from Parkway, plus there was a pump with Black Rat cider.  I had BOB, which was in good condition.  A good place to drop in (if you really must visit Bridgwater town centre) and worth including in a crawl." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
