[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/70036/" title="Attractive place, with the main builing in traditional West Kent style with a tile-hung facade at first floor level, and two small single-storey side extensions.  Once the George, then known as the Standing(s) Cross for quite a while and then a near-restaurant called Morello for a short period.  However, it is now firmly established as a top-end (as in eye-wateringly expensive) gastro-pub but the bar remains an attractive place for a drink, if you can find a seat at the bar or at a table not set aside for those eating.  Upmarket dining rooms to side and rear.  Beer-wise, two of three handpumps are usually in operation, and on this visit we found Harvey\'s (£4.00) and Spirit of Kent from Westerham.  Overall, whilst not everybody\'s idea of a pub, it is all rather tastefully done." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
