[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/22912/" title="An traditional looking street corner pub located down a residential side street but just a minute or two’s walk from Sloane Square, it looks quite attractive with hanging baskets and other foliage outside, and many punters were sat outside enjoying the sun on our recent Sunday afternoon visit.

Internally it’s got a reasonably traditional style to it, although has perhaps been renovated at some time and doesn’t feel as authentically original as many others in the vicinity. It consists of a single U-shaped room wrapped around a central bar counter. A tartan style carpet was on the floor with dark wood panelling on the lower part of the walls and royal blue paintwork above. A small fireplace was off tone one side, with some unusual wallpaper on the chimney breast containing porcelain figureheads. At the rear the walls were entirely clad in oak wood panelling, giving something of an elegant, hotel drawing room feel, and there were a number of old black and white pictures of the locale dotted around the walls. Padded bench seating was around much of the perimeter, as well as a number of high stools. 

Beers on tap were all from Shepherd Neame with their Whitstable Bay, Spitfire and Master Brew. The solitary cider was Orchard View, which was a new one on me. Apparently it’s a collaboration between Shep’s and Aspall’s, and went down surprisingly well given the latter’s involvement. All in all, not the most exciting pub perhaps, but worth taking a short stroll to find something a little more peaceful and less pretentious than many of the other nearby options." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
