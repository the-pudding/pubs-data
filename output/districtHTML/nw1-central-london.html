[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/22789/" title="At the edge of the redevelopment for HS2,this pub has replaced the demolished and not missed Bree Louise in the 2020 GBG.It\'s an airy ,open plan single room with low backed seating booths in tartan along the large windows,a rank of very high tables (even for someone 6\'4\'\')down the side and some wooden tables and chairs in the centre.There is a drop down screen ,showing World Cup rugby on my trip.
There are 6 handpumps with a real cider along with Harvey Sussex Bitter,Sambrooks Pale,Truman Zephyr,Hogs Back TEA and a regular Titanic Plum Porter (£4 with 10% CAMRA discount,NBSS 3)which saved the day from an otherwise dull selection.There is some craft keg but lots of dross.
Food is served 9am -10pm from an all day brunch menu of breakfast and burgers.
Lacking much natural charm,it\'s a functional real ale pub but not good enough to justify passing up either the Euston Tap or Doric Arch.Maybe one for a crawl visit." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
