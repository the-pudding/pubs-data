[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/86007/" title="Set in a typical 60s/70s shopping precinct, in a converted shop unit , it is decked out with basic wooden/metal seating. On the bar there are eight handpumps, six for cask beer and two for Cider, a similar number of Craft keg taps alongside them. Normally in micropubs like this I end up on the keg stuff but such was the quality of the cask offerings I stayed with them, the three I had were Vibrant Forest Summerlands 3.5%, Vibrant Forest/Butchers Hook Metamorph 5.5% and a possible beer of the year, New Bristol Irish Cream Stout, a hefty 7.0% but sublime. Just three minutes walk from the train station its well worth the trip, a good double header with the Steam Town Brew House one stop down the line in Eastleigh." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/86173/" title="This brew-pub is a breath of fresh air to a town bereft of any other decent watering holes in my view.Five minutes walk from the train station, It has two medium sized rooms yet manages to feel like a micropub, though it\'s not. Wooden floors, exposed brick walls in the front room with mixed seating, high and low, a piano sits in one corner and a log burner handy for the colder months. In the second room the floor is of polished concrete, the seating is more uniform tables and chairs and all along the back wall is a row of ex first class train seats and tables.In the far corner the Steam Town Brew Co brewery kit is visible through window panels and glass doors.The bar is back in the front room under a giant station clock, with eight handpumps , six for there own range of beers and two for Cider.On the back wall are 16 craft taps. Beers I tried on my slightly extended stay were in cask , Steam Town Stoke Pale , and in keykeg Dark Star Lager and Red Cat Driftwood, all were good. A very good find." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
