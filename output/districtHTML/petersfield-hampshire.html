[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/63799/" title="Walkable from the famed Harrow in nearby Steep, this boxy-looking pub is situated by a triangular village green which houses a magnificent horse chestnut tree, red telephone box and red post box - it doesn\'t get more English than this. There\'s a raised beer garden opposite the pub which was well-populated on our Bank Holiday weekend visit, with a band tuning up in a marquee stage next to the pub. Internally, the pub has a bar counter facing the entrance and is a two-roomer with small dining area to the rear. A new addition is what appears to be a tea room accessed via a corridor to the right. The menu appears to be Italian-based, although we weren\'t here to eat. Either four or five ales on display (I didn\'t make notes), along with a real cider. I had a pint of Prancing Pony Hopwork Orange which was superb. This is well worth doubling up with The Harrow if you get the chance to visit the latter and it\'s suprising no-one has had a chance to review this one prior to me.
