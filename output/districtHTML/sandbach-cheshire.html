[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/68503/" title="ORIGINAL REVIEW August 2014
The pub is situated at the head of the yard leading to Wheelock Wharf on the Trent & Mersey Canal,so a few boaters will mix with the loyal band of locals.The only entrance is off the street,and the low ceilings show the buildings age,while the interior is on many levels,descending to the rear.Opposite the bar there is a large banquette bound in red leather while some traditional furniture occupies the area infront of the other front window.There is a lower rear section with some more seating and a darts board,but overall space is quite limited creating a good atmosphere with lots of banter between the regulars.There is a small Sky Sports flatscreen above the banquette,but off during my Sunday evening visit.There is a large beer garden at the rear ,with it\'s own entrance off the street,and this is a dog friendly area.Pub grub is available most sessions until around 8pm,while on Sundays traditional roasts are served until 4pm.
This is a Hyde\'s tied house with Original Bitter always on (£2.80,well kept justifying the Cask Marque )while another handpump will serve an occasional guest,but not on my trip.
It\'s a cosy spot,a traditional boozer which isn\'t dominated by food .If  more real ale choice was available,I would have awarded a higher rating.

UPDATE

This Hydes tied house has had a very tasteful refurb,yet still retains the pleasing seperate sections away from the rear serving bar.It\'s neat and tidy with a decent beer garden.The ale range has increased to 4 choices ,although Banks\'s Sunbeam was reversed,leaving Hydes Original,something I failed to note and a very decent Lowry on fine form.The barmaids were welcoming and fun,the Sky Sports coverage was on mute which was very sensible given the low ceilings and I would be happy to have a session within.Now the only pub in Wheelock but it\'s a good \'un." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/68505/" title="This Georgian building is tucked away and looks a bit scruffy from the outside,but the unspoilt interior is worthy of inspection.To the left of the entrance is a former restaurant,unused these days apart from as a furniture storage area,while the dark corridor leads you first to a charming snug and then ,past some gaming machines,to the main tap room.The snug has lots of wood panelling,fitted benches around the walls,bell pushes,30\'s draught screens,a small fireplace , rather tatty wicker chairs but it\'s own serving counter.The tap room is larger with it\'s own entrance,the main bar and a small TV which was being switched between Sky Sports News and terrestrial channels by one of the locals.Off the tap room is a seperate function room,which is used by bands as the pub has a music license.I was in on a Sunday evening and the band were in full swing,but with the door closed the live music did not dominate proceedings. The pub is popular with regulars,and well supported.It\'s charm lies in it\'s well used appearance.Clearly it could be tarted up ,but the atmosphere may be lost.
There are four handpumps but only Weetwood Best Bitter (great value at £2.26,and in good shape)was on,which is their regular ale.There may be an occasional guest.
Despite the name,I could find no sign of accomodation here nor any mention of food.It is a good honest boozer,quirky but worth a visit for a step back in time,or to catch some live music." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
