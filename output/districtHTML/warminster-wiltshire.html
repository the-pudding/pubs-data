[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/69936/" title="A decent village pub offering a warm welcome and a well-kept pint – it has a GBG entry.  It caters well for its locals as well as diners.  There is a large car park but no real garden.  The outside area is a large paved yard with seats and sofas, not just for smokers, and there are pleasant views over the neighbouring fields.  Inside, the rooms are opened out to form a single bar with plenty of space between the small wooden tables.  There are fake beams, an open fire in a brick fireplace and agreeable décor.  The food was freshly cooked and good value, and the landlord was friendly enough.  Three ales on, Bristol Beer Factory’s Notorious, Box’s Piston Broke and Bucombe Original, slightly too chilled but otherwise in excellent condition.  I’d be very happy to come back here again, and it’s convenient to the A303." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
