[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/38717/" title="A local pub which feels like a low-budget GK pub only worse.  The interior is well described by Soupy, below.  There is a reasonably sized car park at the front adjoined by a paved smoking area, a good-sized garden and second smoking area behind and a children’s play area, also at the back.  We made the mistake of eating, ordering off the laminated fast-food menu – the meals were luke-warm, swimming in grease and tasteless.  The ales on were Wye Valley Butty Bach, Doombar, Abbott and GK IPA.  The beer was at least tolerable, and I would happily have had more if time allowed.  Unless staying locally, though, I’d kick this one into touch." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
