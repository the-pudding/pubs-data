[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/32981/" title="A Victorian back-street boozer and a very friendly local for the man drinking, the drinking man who enjoys ale and cider or who just necks Kaliber.  It capitalises a little bit on the Arthurian theme surrounding the town, but it’s unspoilt by the tourism.  It has been knocked through to have a long bar which slopes from back to front.  At the back is a comfy seating area with a piano, at the front is a proper bar with bar stools, a round table and other seating.  They host regular live music and open mic knights.  There is a large TV screen which was turned off, while the jukebox was playing a fairly interesting assortment of music including reggae versions of Pink Floyd classics which, bizarrely, worked quite well.  Six boxed ciders were behind the bar plus an Orchard Pig on draft. This was complemented by three ales, two from Hoff, including the pub’s house beer, plus Harding’s Somerset Best Bitter.  The ales were in superb condition.  An excellent afternoon in a pub to which I’d like to come a lot more often, especially in Summer linking it with other nearby pubs. It’s on the 2019 Somerset Ale Grail." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/81100/" title="A new purpose-built pub opened in 2013 as part of the renovated tannery site, associated with the neighbouring Premier Inn with which it shares a car park.  There is a narrow lawned garden with wooden tables and chairs (chained together) at the front, but the traffic noise from the adjacent main road means that it’s only smokers and noisy children who use it, and even the latter stray inside more often than not.  The single large bar and dining room has a small lounge-like seating area with an open fire and a TV, while the rest of the room, which is partially obscured by a central pillar, is tiled and a bit soulless.   There are a couple of gaming machines dotted around but little else by way of variety.  The staff were quite friendly and helpful, and while the standard menu was the typical factory stuff, the carvery looked rather good and was reasonable VFM for a family in transit.  Only one ale on, Doombar, which wasn’t in great condition.  Better than many of these places, OK for a quickie if passing, but not somewhere to spend an evening unless you’re staying in the Premier." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
