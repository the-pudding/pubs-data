[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/37258/" title="A nondescript roadhouse which endured a refurbishment about twenty years ago.  Time has not healed, and it feels depressingly suburban inside.  Too much emphasis on food to make it feel comfortable, with all normal tables reserved at 4pm despite a paucity of punters. Drinkers are meant to perch on the stupid high stools, unhelpful if you\'re in a wheelchair.

The Hooky bitter was fine, though £4 a pint is ambitious for such a humdrum location. 

If you\'re passing this way the Folly is orders of magnitude better." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
