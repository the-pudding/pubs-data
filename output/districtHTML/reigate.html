Two cask beers available from the four handles on the bar, both from a fairly local brewery Pilgrim ,Progress and Surrey,the former was decent. On the downside modern dance music was being played far to loud, this at early lunchtime , competing with Come dine with me on TV, I\'m not sure the young Eastern European couple (I think) who appeared to be the new tenants, have completely grasped the meaning of a traditional English pub.A pub that could do better in my view but nonetheless better open than closed." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
