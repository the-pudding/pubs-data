Two ales on with a third pump unclipped - Fuller\'s London Pride and an OK Adnam\'s Southwold Bitter. It looks like a nice backstreet boozer, but the ale selection and a quiet weekday afternoon visit didn\'t do this place the justice it probably deserves." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/55734/" title="Yes, this is a bit of a corporate dining restaurant, but as others have said the main bar area outside of the large dining conservatory is OK to just have a drink in and the pub also has the benefit of a lot of outside drinking space with the elevated patio to the front and the large garden to the side.
Both the Pride and Doombar were on for my visit but as the sun was now fully up towards late afternoon when I got here and I’d already enjoyed some good ales beforehand I just wanted something reliable and cold so also went for a half of one of the available Meantime craft brews and headed out into the garden.
I’ve never eaten here but have enjoyed a beer in the garden on a few occasions and last week was no exception. The only slight issue is that due to the local clientele this pub / restaurant attracts you have to be prepared to put up with a fair amount of braying whilst enjoying the garden. But in one way it’s always useful to have it reconfirmed that there is no direct correlation between inherited wealth and brains." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
