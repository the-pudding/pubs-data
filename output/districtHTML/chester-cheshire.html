[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/84243/" title="Not easy to find and tucked away from the tourist throng,this is a great micropub run by a beer enthusiast .It\'s an old shop but nicely done with the ceiling full of pump clips from the rotating selection,fairy lighting around the top of the walls and high tables with various stools making good use of the limited space.There is a corridor with more overflow seating on the way to the unisex loo.
The bar runs along the back wall and has 4 handpumps and a few more keg taps.On my trip the ale line up was Peerless Oatmeal Stout,Sanoma Pale and a very well kept Kirkstall Three Swords,while the keg selection had higher ABV options but well chosen from leading microbrewers plus sparkling ciders.My big finish after a small crawl around the city was Northern Monk Faith on keg,a top pint.
It\'s popular and chatty and it\'s easy to fall into conversations with regulars and the owner,who gets some grief for being a manc and supporting Man City.He did however choose a very good soundtrack played at a sensible volume.
This is a must visit when in Chester ,a fun place to visit and a leading example of all that\'s good in a micro pub.It attracts a wide range of ages and is thankfully not the preserve of the local CAMRA branch although it is listed in the 2019 GBG.Go visit." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
