[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87948/" title="This micropub conversion of a high street shop was covered in scaffolding when I visited, but the interior was unaffected. The bar has two hand pumps facing when entering, with a gantry of keg fonts facing the left hand wall. I was informed that all the beers thereon are key keg, meaning they are real ale in a bag, untouched by extraneous carbon dioxide. I usually avoid Sheffield beers when on my travels - I can drink them at home, after all - but made an exception here for the Steel City/Lost Industry collaboration: Stout Wars Episode IX, a barrel aged imperial stout that weighed in at 12% abv. This was very impressive, but I couldn\'t help the treasonous thought that a similar effect could be had with a half of 80/- and a wee dram of scotch tipped in.

There\'s a good selection of bottles, which are 20% cheaper to take out (or 25% more expensive to drink in, depending on your point of view). The owner and the two locals were very friendly and the background music was interesting. The pub is closed Mondays and Tuesdays." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
