The small L-shaped bar located adjacent to the entrance faces some tables that line the front windows. To the left is a double-sided chimney breast with log burner that splits two seating areas. The rear windows have great views across Rastrick cricket club and the fields beyond. There is no television and there was no music playing, but there was a good atmosphere generated by the handful of locals and the extremely friendly owners.
The bar supports a standard keg range alongside Staropramen. I counted seven hand pumps that, during my recent Tuesday afternoon visit, were drawing Timothy Taylor Landlord and Golden Best alongside Bradfield Brewery’s Farmers Blonde, Copper Dragon Penny Pale, Sharps Doom Bar, Roundhill Brewery’s Citra and Squawk Pica Oat Pale. Food is not available, and the doors do not open until 16:00 during the week and midday at the weekend.
This is an excellent pub well worth going out of the way to visit!" class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/73009/" title="I popped into the Four Sons on a recent Tuesday afternoon when there were a handful of old locals at the bar, some of whom were moaning about Tipping Point being aired loudly on the television. After some discussion the woman behind the bar relented and switched the TV off and the back music on. Sky Sports and BT Sport are advertised, as is a pool table that I didn’t see within the L-shaped interior. Thick wooden tables with high backed chairs are found throughout and highchairs stacked by the entrance suggest that this is a family friendly pub. Food is available, but I didn’t see any menus so the kitchen must have been closed during my visit. Out the back is a beer garden that I did not visit due to the inclement weather.
Available from the bar is a standard and premium keg range. Two of the six hand pumps were unused which left Bass, Timothy Taylor Boltmaker, Oakham Citra and Ossett Yorkshire Blonde as the cask ale options. This is the sort of place I would go for a bite to eat before moving on to a more traditional pub." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
