[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/84719/" title="The Sixpenny Brewery started life in Addlestone, Surrey, when it was known as the Wayland Brewery, before a move to rural Dorset in the village of Sixpenny Handley, where they operated a respected brewery and small taproom from a set of farm outbuildings on the edge of the village. In 2016, the brewery looked to expand, and ended up relocating again, this time a much shorter distance away, just outside of Cranborne. This move allowed them to open a much bigger taproom which is open seven days a week and offers a much more comfortable drinking experience than the old shed used to. This well put together bar is located in another former farm outbuilding and has nice exposed brick walls and ceiling beams, tile flooring and a conventional servery along the right hand wall. The pub has a very rustic feel thanks to hop-lined beams, light fittings made from old cartwheels and various pictures and photos relating to countryside life on the walls, not to mention the farmers stood at the bar, one of whom tried to get me to buy some of his honey! Seating is mainly in the form of sturdy benches and chairs with plenty of cushions dotted around to soften the otherwise quite hard seating. The remaining decor includes smart mirrors, a beer board and an old Sixpenny Handley village signpost, plus a few other retro bits and bobs that are well worth exploring. Outside, a sizeable patio seating area would work well in the summer months and there is a good car park behind the toilet block.
There were four Sixpenny beers on handpull on this visit – 6D Best, 6D Gold, Black and IPA. My father and I both sampled the Black, which we thought was in great shape (the friendly barmaid went and put on a new cask as we arrived) and it was a shame we couldn’t stay longer to sample more of their range. Bottles are available for takeout, as are growlers and various milk bottle sizes.
I really liked this place, which felt like a massive upgrade on their original bar and a great place to try some excellent ale at source. The place is quite remote and takes a fair bit of finding, but persistence will bring rewards and I’d recommend making the effort to get out and check this place out." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

Entering through a ga... [<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/10301/" title="This is the sole pub in the tiny National Trust owned village of Pamphill, set in a hollow on the fringes of the village and offering a chance to explore a relatively untouched parlour pub of the sort that barely exists anymore. Entering through a gate into the attractive gravel beer garden, there are two entrances for either the front public or rear lounge bars. The Public Bar is a minuscule space with a few stools to either side  and not much room for a whole lot else. The servery is on the back wall and has a single hand pump, with the remaining beer all dispensed from a taproom to the side. The bar has a traditional counter with a cluttered gantry above, draped with all kinds of items which distract you as you wait for your pint to be fetched. The decor is all in keeping with the pub\'s heritage and includes old bits of breweriana and the inevitable paintings of rural scenes. Stairs lead up to a first floor room with a fair bit of additional seating which is essential outside of the summer months, as the two bars are far too small to support more than a small handful of customers. I visited on a baking summer\'s day, so gave this area a swerve, heading instead to the cheerful garden area, where a book swap had been set up next to the lounge entrance. The lounge has enough room for three small tables and some dated looking chairs and has a tiny servery with no handpulls. There\'s a nice fireplace in here to one side of the bar with a selection of pub and wildlife themed books on the mantle. More traditional pictures line the walls alongside mirrors, plates and the like. The radio was quietly playing in the background, but it was hardly a distraction, with the chatter of the locals easily drowning it out. The gardens main highlight is the eponymous vine, which spreads out across a remarkably large area, supported by a much needed trellis.
The beer on handpull was Goddards Ale of Wight, whilst the taproom had two more in the shape of Branscombe Vale Golden Fiddle and Palmers IPA. The Ale of Wight was in fine condition and I was made to feel very welcome by the merry band of locals who I had to squeeze past to get served and by the friendly barmaid.
This is a lovely old pub that almost feels like a working museum piece, such is it\'s singular feel and antiquated charm. Sure, there are problems with practicalities, especially at busy times, and the ale range isn\'t going to be to everyone\'s taste, but I really enjoyed snooping around such an unusual pub and mingling with the locals. Definitely the sort of place anyone interested in pub history should make a trip out to." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
