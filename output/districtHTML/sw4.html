[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/54612/" title="Been through a few name changes, North Pole, Mistress P\'s and now Traders. Looked like it was turning into a restrauant. Paid a visit and was plesantly surprised. Still a pub but now has an Oriental feel to it. Worth a visit if you\'re in the area. Has changed again, it is now a Mogolian restaurant, not sure if it can still be clasified as a drinking establishment. Update: The place has now changed back into a pub and got a new name, Old Town Tavern, boasts that it has 20 taps, these taps are for gas beer only. Aparently each one cost £5.00 a pint. No real ale. I\'ve altered my rating to the middle choice until I visit and can make a informed rating." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

Had 2 ales on tap. Ordered a Timothy Taylor Landlord. The place wasn\'t busy so the pint didn\'t need to be rushed. The froth reached the top of the glass but it was still settling. We both waited as the ale cleared in the glass and the head shrunk. It wasn\'t one of those over sized glasses, so the pint should have reached the top. The barmaid said, it looks okay to me, even though I could see clear glass for the top 1/4 inch. J asked for a top up an as usual, it was pulled fast, so lots of spillage down the sides. After all that, it cost me £4.50. Don\'t think I will return unless really desperate for a pint." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
