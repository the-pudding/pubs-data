[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/57486/" title="A bucolic location for this whitewashed country village pub on a triangular village green which doubles as a cricket pitch in the summer months and itself also overlooked by Sir Edwin Lutyens\' brick and half-timbered village hall which dates from 1893. Indeed the pub may well serve as the cricket club\'s de facto bar with the many team photos adorning the walls of the bar. Four ales in the shape of Sharp\'s Doom Bar, Fuller\'s Sticky Wicket, Hogs Back TEA and Surrey Hills Ranmore - the latter excellent, albeit £4.20 for a pint\'s worth. We managed to secure a bench out front to watch a bit of leather on willow along with a generous following of locals. For auto fans, there are also some nice bits about former local lad Mike Hawthorn on the wall outside the Gents." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

      <p>Foodie pub away from Tilford green, heaving on our Saturday arvo visit with lunchtime dinners. Three locals beers from Tilford Brewery which is based in a building next to the pub premises - Red Mist, Gold and Wit - all on fine form.</p>
