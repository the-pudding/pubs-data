      <p>Must read Roger Buttons review.  Not sure if they sell crisps, but there was definitely mini chedders on the bar!

Nothing more to add to the other desriptions except watch your head on the ceilings and the Uley Pigs Ear was in top condition.

Two roomed - dog friendly bar and carpetted dining room/lounge - joined by a single long bar spanning both rooms.   Of course, this means the staff are never at the correct side :-)

Chalk board with meaningful information of the 5 real ales on....  Arkells, Green King giving way to more palatable Fullers, Hobsons and JW Lees.

Beer in great condition but the £7.95 Sunday Lunch was a real bargain.

Simple but getting everything right.
