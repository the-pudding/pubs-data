[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/58001/" title="UPDATE - 15th December 2018:
The only thing that seems to have changed in this pub in Soho Farmhouse country is the name: internally the layout and decor remaining exactly as my previous visit two-and-a-half years ago, although menu-wise, it\'s not solely about the fish (a couple of \'warm\' fridges holding hunks of meat testifying to that). Hook Norton Hooky remained on the leg stump, augmented by TT Landlord and a locAle I\'d not heard of before - Chadlington Oxford IPA - which was excellent, albeit £4.80 for a pint.

31st May 2016
Unashamedly gastro and with an emphasis on fish dishes, the Masons is situated on the busy A361 between Banbury and Chipping Norton. Internally it\'s geared up for dining as one would imagine, with a main dining area taking up the majority of the building, and further tables and chairs set up to the right of the small bar, although there were a couple of stools up at the bar and a smallish area opposite where drinking did not seem to be frowned upon. An attractive beer garden offered views out towards nearby Hook Norton. Ales were Brakspear Bitter and Jennings Cumberland, the latter of which came in at £2.00 a half. Probably best to leave this one to the pescophiles." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

      <p>More specifically, a Lebanese restaurant. The bar still functions as one, but the two pumps were decisively unclipped with, as I found out, very little chance of resurrection. A pint of keg Camden Pale was &pound;4.95.

22nd August 2017
Now The Cinnamon Stick: a Middle Eastern restaurant. No real ales yet, but they\'re hoping to house two locAles, likely one each from Hook Norton and Wychwood.

5th September 2016
Now under stable management after a period as an Indian restaurant and bar and some mismanagement thereafter. This also doubles as the Carpenters Smokehouse with an unseen eating area located down a few steps to the left. A central bar faces you on entry with an interior of all stone and wood as is the style in these parts. Ales were Old Speckled Hen, Old Golden Hen, Carpenters Ale (rebadged XT4) and XT16 - a 6% quadruple-hopper which was a bargain at just £1.50 a half. The bar area wasn\'t the largest in the world and there were a few colourful, yet harmless locals in and around the bar area, so them and coupled with Absolute 80s on the radio, means it\'s probably not one for a quiet drink, but good to see another village pub turned around and ticking over." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
