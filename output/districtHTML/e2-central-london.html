The pub dates back to at least 1826 but was rebuilt in 1936. It\'s quite large inside with a downstairs music venue and DJ paraphernalia in the ground floor bar. There\'s a slightly raised area with peripheral, upholstered banquette to the right side of the wood panelled room. The long bar is to the left with a quite attractive stained glass-fronted pot shelf. The floor is rough bare boarded, walls above the panelling are black and there\'s a white coffered ceiling with dentils. Lighting comprises some fairly standard modern hanging glass shades with illumination to the rear provided by a huge and distracting neon \'burger\' sign. To the rear is another room, small and similarly panelled; furniture is wooden and basic. There\'s no obvious signs of décor apart from flyers advertising upcoming music events. Music played at an unobtrusive level but presumably this was so that it wouldn\'t clash with the football commentary coming from the TV to the rear room and projector screen in the main bar. As you\'d expect in a live music/dive bar, the lavs are a bit scruffy. There were hardly any customers in here, but they were a mixed bunch.
It\'s card-only payment in here and on our visit, fizz-only as apart from the two unused pumps, all four of the others had clips reversed; my half of Camden\'s Pale came in at a wincing £2.90.
This isn\'t a great place by any stretch of the imagination and I imagine that it\'s predominantly geared towards the young, so don\'t envisage a return visit." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/66996/" title="Not realising I’d done this one before a few years ago, I popped in without expecting anything. It’s still a classic corner pub that has mercifully stayed out of the hands of the hipsters retains a traditional feel. Enter to a small L shaped bar with half-length varnish wood panelling, mint painted uppers. Noted the classic and rarely seen circular curtain to pull in front of the door on cold nights. Some modern filament lights are the only encroachment and even those are fairly tasteful. To rear right is a discrete doorway which leads to a back room and small garden. Three pumps with two ales and a cider. Tim Taylor Landlord and Adnams Mosaic as the choices, the latter was a good drop (NBSS 3.5) if expensive at £2.70 a half. 12 kegs with an eclectic selection too. Punters on the \'moved to Shoreditch on daddy\'s funds yah\' spectrum but could be worse. Enjoyable stop. 7.5

October 2010
A grand old corner pub recently re-opened, this makes for a good stop-off if touring the Brick Lane area for a bit of the ethnic grub as it’s a decent yomp away from Liverpool St station. Three ales (Trumans Runner brewed by Nethergate, Adnams Old Ale and TT Landlord) available on my visit and although certainly not cheap, the Trumans was in good shape. An interesting selection of bottled beers was available alongside prominently-advertised coffee. The recently refurbed interior has a horseshoe shaped bar which is quite lively, with a quieter drinking area at the right rear. The big etched windows at the pub’s front allow for a lot of welcome light to give a contrast to the dark wood floor, chairs and tables. Is the greenery dangling in the interior real though? Unobtrusive piped music and good atmosphere made for an enjoyable visit, despite being a bit of a hipster magnet. In an area struggling for good pubs, this one is well-worth your time.
