[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87697/" title="A brand new (May 2019) NuMarston\'s \'Rotisserie\' build on a newish development near Bletchley named after the codebreaker célèbre. The odd bit of breweriana, photos of local villages before New Town MK sprang up and some bits about Alan Turing himself. Three ales over two separate banks of three from the Marston\'s family - Wainwright\'s Golden Ale, Marston\'s Pedigree and Wychwood Hobgoblin. The Wainwright\'s was quaffable enough and £3.40 for a pint. They\'ve done a pretty good job of this one, but it\'s not going to set Camra pulses racing." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

A small mid terrace boozer,the steep entrance steps give some clues as to its considerable age.The interior is quite cramped and the beams and large inglenook to the left are not made a feature of,the sofas around the former fireplace dont enhance the area.The bay window is a feature but with multiple sports screens the atmosphere can be dominated by the coverage.The fruit machine with a note accepter was eating one punters wages,while electric cables were taped to beams and walls,sockets had multiple plugs,it needs a good rewiring job.There were two handpumps both with Vale ales,although one was reversed leaving a decent Vale Red Kite (£3) as the only option.
The pub does B&B and several drinkers retired up stairs after supping but I would guess accomodation is priced at the value end of the  scale.Karaoke every Friday and Saturday night,to my mind there doesnt seem enough room unless everyone is expected to join in.
With some investment this pub could be transformed into a cosy establishment and if Vale were prepared to increase the number of handpumps and stock more of their excellent range who knows how succesful it could be.At present a bit of a missed opportunity.

UPDATE 

Vale Brewery have done just as suggested above,this is now an excellent drinking venue.The interior has been restored and the bar sited to the left,while there is much exposed brickwork throughout,original features uncovered and the back room now well decorated.The inglenook behind the bar contains up to 4 real ciders on stillage,there is a small selection of craft keg beers with brews from Wild Beer and Blackened Sun catching the eye and 4 handpumps with Vale Gravitas (tip top condition) and Brill Gold as regulars,a third Vale brew will guest,often a seasonal,while there will be one genuine guest although this was settling on my trip.There is a beer list of bottles.The regular Vale Gravitas will always make this pub the destination real ale house in Fenny Stratford and the food options will come from the grill and feature a lot of burgers besides other dishes.
Well done to the Vale Brewery,this is now a charming pub to visit and marks have increased as a result." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
