[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/23287/" title="Just a short walk from South Kensington tube station and the museum district, this is a simple Greene King pub with a few nice features. The pub has a bare boarded interior which wraps itself around a centrally positioned servery, with checkerboard tiling around the floor of the whole bar area. The servery has an angular dark wood counter, smart bar back with modern dark wood panels and etched glass mirrors, plus contemporary-styled pot shelves hung from a high canopy which has been decorated with lincrusta. High tables and stools stand beneath the front windows, one of which has a particularly attractive curved pane bearing an etching of the pub’s name. More high tables and stools clutter the space behind the bar, but there is a decent seating area through a series of arches along the back wall, where comfier seating has been arranged under wood panelled walls decorated with traditional paintings. A few fine etched glass mirrors to the rear right part of the bar add to the pub’s traditional feel, but for every nice feature such as that, there are plenty of corporate promotional items to spoil the overall effect. Music was playing quietly in the background and there were a lot of people eating throughout the pub, despite the post-work crush of the crowd.
There are six handpulls on the bar and these were dispensing Greene King IPA and Abbot Ale, Windsor & Eton Knight of the Garter and Guardsman, Enfield Speculation and Old Rosie Cider. The staff were particularly friendly but served up a rotten pint of the Speculation, which, at £4.95, was undrinkable – too many ales on to match demand I suspect.
I don’t think Greene King have done this place any favours. The corporate nonsense throughout this pub really detracts from what is otherwise quite an interesting building with some nice traditional features, whilst the expansion of the ale range seems to have adversely affected quality. Overall, this was a real let-down and has been struck off the list of potential watering holes when I’m in this part of town." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/23236/" title="A traditional looking pub located down a side street but just off of the Fulham Road, it has an attractive appearance with lots of hanging baskets and was very busy on our Saturday afternoon visit with far more punters on the terrace outside and even spilling out on to the pavement than there were inside.

It’s quite traditional in terms of décor with dark wooden boards on the floor, dark wood panelling on the wall to the left and some yellow patterned wallpaper to the right. A small tiled fireplace was off to one side although it looked as though this was probably no longer used, and above this was an oil painting of a reclining nude. Elsewhere was a large Burton Ales mirror as well as some old black and white photographs and a couple of TV screens, although fortunately these were not in use on our visit. The room was broken up a little with some wood and glass partitioning, and some of the glass was attractively etched. Green padded bench seating was around much of the perimeter. A further room down a few steps to the left had a “Please waited to be seated” lectern at the entrance, so was presumably intended for dining.  

Beers on tap were Moncada Notting Hill APA, Abbott Ale, Timothy Taylor Landlord, Sambrook’s Wandle, St Austell Tribute and Greene King IPA. Prices seemed expensive with a couple of pints coming in at a hefty £12." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
