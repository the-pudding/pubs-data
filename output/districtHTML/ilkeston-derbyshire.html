[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/7427/" title="My first pint of Leadmill Oak Pale Ale didn\'t touch the sides, plus one of the best ham salad cobs to be had, what a superb start to our visit here. The bar side situated on the right hand side of the entrance had already attracted a bunch of locals happily chatting away on our Saturday lunchtime visit.
A couple of walkers and a chap along with his dog, enjoyed the tranquility of the left hand side lounge, reading the papers. At the back of the pub, we found a further indoor bar serving 8 ales and 3 ciders served from stillage, plus a seated dining area on the adjacent side. A young girl had brought in a large lemon curd cake, whilst we were seated in the \"Old Stables Bar\" at the rear and brought us over a decent slice of the cake for us to try. Eat your heart out Paul Hollywood, as it was excellent. The front bar hosted 8 pumps, serving 5 guest and 3 Leadmill beers." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
