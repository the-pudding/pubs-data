December 2013
Doesn’t immediately shout ‘pub!’ from the roadside and would be easy to miss it. The inside has been stripped right back and is very clinical, severely lacking charm bar the real fire. Four pumps with three ales, two from Greene King (why?) and West Berks Mr Chubbs that went down well. Noticing that bar snacks were advertised (and feeling the beer sloshing around my empty stomach) I asked for a scotch egg, assuming it’d come out of a container at the bar or from a fridge (no clues given by the largely silent foreign barman)…he disappeared so I sat down. Got given a placemat and cutlery. Waited for a bit. Was just about to query at the bar when out came the egg which had been freshly cooked and was runny in the middle. Tasted fantastic and at less than four quid I was pretty happy. Accommodation offered. WiFi pinged but wouldn’t connect. As a pub I didn’t take to this one at all but the good beer condition and the fantastic scotch egg save it from my wrath. Rated 6" class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

March 2014 
A big pub off the main road, serving the (seemingly boarded-up) estate. Not as rough as we expected. Corporate interior, no real charm bar a few prints in the left end of the room but at least well maintained, with double glazing etc. TVs showing Six Nations rugby plus two pool tables available. Very quiet, though it looks like a lot of the flats next door have been emptied and condemned which presumably has deprived the pub of a fair bit of local custom. Two ales, Wadworth 6X and Doombar (good nick). The solitary barman was doing a fair job, given that he was also processing kitchen orders. 30 different burgers (in reality, mainly different combinations of filling) listed on a blackboard as their USP. Surprisingly OK and more of an asset than liability to the local area. Rated 5.5" class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
