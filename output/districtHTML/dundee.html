[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87607/" title="On the shore side of the imposing Caird Hall, this newly opened bar and restaurant is a welcome addition to central Dundee.  The spacious interior is in three parts: the main bar to the left (with a snug of sorts beside the entrance), a formal restaurant to the right and an intermediate seating / dining area (with its own island bar) in between.  Smart modern furniture and decor throughout.  A total of 20 craft beers and ciders are available on taps mounted on the main servery bar-back, with many (expensive) guests from far and wide - e.g. Boundary APA from Northern Ireland (£5.70) - in addition to several of its own products." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
