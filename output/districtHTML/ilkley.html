[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/66316/" title="A quiet two room pub, both rooms with people in at the time of my afternoon visit but still very quiet.  This is a Wharfedale brew pub and there are three of their ales take the centre hand pulls on the bar (a blonde, bitter and a mild) accompanied by six guests (one of which was off).

I like to try the local beers whenever I can but I found the Wharfedale Blonde not to be anything special and I was left feeling I probably should have gone for one of the guest ales instead.  I can\'t remember the full lineup of guests but it included the excellent Titanic Plum Porter.

There was a wood burning stove going in the main room.  The gents were modern and clean.  There is apparently a function room available for hire.

Definitely worth a look." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/55362/" title="The carvery on a Sunday used to be excellent. It’s still good, although the price has risen to £9.50. But what put us off is the surly attitude of the bar staff, who used to be so friendly. There were only 2 beers on tap, instead of the usual 4. The Saltaire blonde tasted flat and the Timothy Tailors wasn’t much better. One of us wanted a Fosters. It was off. So he ordered a Guinness. He couldn’t drink it, it was that bad. We mentioned this to the barman, no apology, he seemed like he couldn’t care less.
Then we came to pay. I payed £37.50 with a card. As we were walking out my friend said that seems a lot. So I asked how much was the carvery. He said £9.50. So why was the bill not £28.50. He said we hadn’t paid for our drinks. We definitely had, my friend remembered clearly paying. So he backed off the bill, but not the slightest apology. Then he turned to me and said we had a heavy night last night. Should that be our problem?
That barman should find himself another job, because he pisses off the customers. We shan’t go back." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
