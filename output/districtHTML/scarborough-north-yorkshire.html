[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/29541/" title="This pub is now located in what used to be the upstairs rooms. They still have a pool table, but the bar is now up here as well. Up a few steps from the street there are now 2 fairly comfortable rooms. It is a bit like drinking in someone\'s house though. Very friendly and a good selection of beer means we\'ll keep coming back.

Not run down and not rough as far as I can see. In fact there have been no major changes in the last year or so. 6 handpumps on the bar featuring Dark Star Hophead and 5 changing guests. We tried 3 of them between us and all were in excellent condition.

The Valley continues to maintain it\'s billing as one of the best real ale pubs in Scarborough. Called in for one a couple of weeks ago and ended up having a couple as it started raining (any excuse). 5 handpumps on the go including Raw Black Lager & Milestone Shire Wood Porter, both of which were excellent. They also had a selection of filled barm cakes on the bar, great value at £1 each. One of the few pubs in Scarborough that we always visit when in town.

June 2009
Pleasant little cellar bar at the top end of Valley Road. Has been all sorts of bar in the past but is now the best that it has ever been. Good, well kept selection of real ales, usually from micros. We often call in on a Saturday lunchtime when it\'s pretty quiet, but always friendly. The artwork on the walls is for sale, some of it is pretty good as well. Being in the well known cider producing region of North Yorkshire, it\'s obvious that they should have been voted the Cider pub of the year. I\'m not a cider drinker myself but top marks for getting the award. If you\'re going to this place try Cellars just further down Valley Road as well. The Valley Road pub crawl, short but good!" class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

      <p>Marstons pub with a large room. Bar to ear as you enter. Surprising selection of ales - Snecklifter, Old Empire, Youngs Special and of course, Pedigree. Worth the walk out from town.</p>
