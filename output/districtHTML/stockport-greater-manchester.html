      <p>Was closed today at 2pm but according to Whatpub should have opened at 12pm however i glanced through the window and saw axes, fake animal skins large horns and lots of other Viking items in fact it looked like an up market version of the Flintstones... [<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/88453/" title="Was closed today at 2pm but according to Whatpub should have opened at 12pm however i glanced through the window and saw axes, fake animal skins large horns and lots of other Viking items in fact it looked like an up market version of the Flintstones cave.  This is a Viking Tapas bar but from what i can gather there is more emphasis on the bar side rather than the tapas. Around 4 beer taps but i think the in drink is the  mead which is served in a large horn." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
