      <p>This is more craft beer off-licence with taps than small bar with off-sales. There&#039;s 4 beers on draught, plus a bunch of fridges (one featuring some some top-quality Belgian ales).

There\'s 4 beers on draught, plus a bunch of fridges (one featuring some some top-quality Belgian ales). Prices are as you would expect from the new wave of craft keg brewers.

It felt a bit too hipster-trendy for my liking, but maybe Worthing\'s just changing faster than I am." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
