[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/85447/" title="Modern pub, housed underneath the rear part of the Montcalm Hotel, featuring a staple-shaped bar, an opened-out room to one side and the shiny micro-brewery in the diagonally opposite corner, all under a high ceiling with industrial ventilation ducting.  Seating mostly along tall benches (with power sockets and menus), although the place was mostly full of post-work vertical drinkers when I called in.  Five different beers from the range available from the two banks of six craft keg taps, in a range of styles including two pale ales, an IPA and a lager, but I went for the dark Stoutford Bridge (£5.50, like the others, but they were doing two-pint steins for this price as an offer when I ordered, so that proved to be an unexpected bargain)." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/23453/" title="A good sized Nicholson’s pub on a street corner plot just around the corner from Liverpool Street station, it consists of one single, open plan room although with some small wooden partitions incorporating stained glass to break up the space slightly.

It is perhaps slightly gloomy internally with dark blue/grey wood panelling on the lower part of the walls, the same colour plasterwork above and a very dark ceiling, although this is offset to some extent by the large windows. Narrow wooden boards were on the floor and there were a few iron supporting pillars for the high ceiling and a small fireplace at one end, although this was not in use. The long bar counter covered most of one wall, and there was some ornately carved woodwork behind this.

Beers on tap were Black Isle’s 20 Hours of Daylight, Sharp’s Atlantic, Doom Bar, London Pride, Nicholson’s Pale Ale, London Brewing’s Flying The Mags and West Berkshire’s Good Old Boy. The solitary cider meanwhile was Mortimer’s Orchard. Overall, whilst there was certainly nothing wrong with this pub, I thought it lacked much in the way of any character, and is certainly less interesting than many of the company’s other outlets." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
