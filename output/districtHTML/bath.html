[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87563/" title="A relatively recent opening on Pultney Bridge, this is primarily a bottle shop rather than a pub, but there are nonetheless four options on tap and seating for approximately 20 punters inside, with some further limited seating on the pavement outside.

Being a shop, the walls were lined with an impressive array of product, much of it being canned rather than bottled. Pricing was on a narrow strip of chalkboard underneath each shelf, and followed the trend that you see on some gastro-pub menus of eliminating both a decimal point and a currency symbol, e.g.; 2¾ 4¼, etc. Large quarry tiles were on the floor and the walling was a shade of battleship grey. The barman was friendly and helpful and was happy to provide samples to try.

Beers on tap were all listed on a chalkboard behind the bar and on this occasion included Omnipollo Niki, Verdant Bloom, Electric Bear Omnishambles and ABC Juice Springstein. Ciders meanwhile were Midford, Iford, Worleys and Thundering. In addition to this, any of the bottles or cans could be purchased to drink on the premises, and they apparently had a gadget that would chill them down in just two minutes. All in all, whilst not a pub in the conventional sense, it’s certainly worth a look and if nothing else you’ll find some very unusual options to take away." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
