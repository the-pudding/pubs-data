[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/22706/" title="A return visit and it would seem that the floor has had a makeover but what - thankfully - has changed is that the awful games machine has gone which adds more appeal. What has also changed is the décor, where once there were framed newspaper front pages from momentous events, there are now pictures of former resident Freddie Mercury cavorting with Samantha Fox which adds nothing. Allied to which, my pint tasted as though the lines hadn\'t been cleaned in quite a while and wasn\'t pleasant to drink. The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away, so the grade remains unchanged.

--------------------------------------------

17th June 2016:

Oddly for this part of the world, this is as mentioned, a Nicholson\'s pub. It dates from 1865 and is tucked away out of the sightline of tourists plodding around dreary Kensington High Street in one of the prettiest enclaves in Kensington. Out front there\'s an awning-covered patio and inside it\'s dark, very traditional and very basic with simple furniture, some settles and lots of dark atmospheric three-quarter height wood panelling. There\'s a pot shelf and behind, there\'s an old back lit Charrington\'s bar parapet - it reminded me a bit of The Windsor Castle up the road. How lovely (well almost). The pub was fairly quiet yet despite this, the barman took 10 minutes to serve me. The bloke standing next to me had been there even longer and it\'s not as if we weren\'t noticed, as the barman kept glancing over at us as he chatted with customers. Added to this there was a TV showing Euro \'16 (for me, a capital offence in a historic pub) and worse, there was a flashing games machine.
Ales: one unused pump, Portobello Bronze Star, Sharp\'s Doom Bar, Nicholson\'s Pale Ale, Littlestone\'s Honey Porter and Glamorgan Brewing Co\'s Pales of the Unexpected at (for the area) a competitive £4.35 a pint and very nice it was too.
I\'ll definitely return as this is a very nice pub indeed. If it put the TV, games machine and useless barman in a skip I\'d probably give it 8/10." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/22709/" title="This pub was built in 1827 and named the Pembroke Arms, it was then rebadged as the Hansom Cab in 1965. The interior layout of the pub consists of a central bar area, with a front and rear lounge, with a couple of tables and chairs squeezed in on the right hand side between both rooms.
The main bar faces you as you enter the pub and has retained its original mahogany bar counter, which is low in height and is quite common of most central London pubs of this era. The rear lounge area was mostly set for dining and the back bar wall had a decent display of etched glass work set in mahogany frame work. Five pumps on the bar with a choice of four ales, London Brewing Co Beer Street, Purity UBU, Twickenham Summer Sun and Bedlam Brewery Phoenix. We went for the Twickenham, which was in excellent condition and cost £6.90 for a pint and a half. The service was very good too." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
