[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/86568/" title="Good Beer Guide 2020 entry.   Was expecting an old mans pub, so was slightly surprised at this cafe style bright, airy place. 

2 cask and around 10 keg.   First cask failed, so changed order to a Spey Valley I\'m not Bitter David.   It looked terrible, but having already been forced into a change once, I was loathe to complain again.

My check in on Untappds prompted the brewery to suggest it was the very dreg of the barrel and I should have taken it back.   My argument is that they shouldn\'t have given it to me in the first place.

Terribly disappointing for a GBG place.   How do they get these recommendations?" class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
