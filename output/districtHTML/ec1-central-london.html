[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/53957/" title="New(ish) bottle shop and craft beer / cider bar from the online merchant, with this branch being housed in a heavily tapered building opposite the north-east corner of Smithfield Market.  Just three tall chairs can be found by the window-ledges on each side of the entrance plus a couple of high tables with a few stools at the far end.  In between, you find the fridges on one side and the bar with 12 taps on an elongated fount opposite (and if you look closely there are also two covered handpumps, not currently in use).  With a good choice of styles from 11 of these, I dithered before going for the Black Iris Endless Summer session IPA (£6.00).  NB - Card only." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
