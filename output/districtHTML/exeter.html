Inside there is a small bar area, then separate sections around the pub at different levels.  Outside there are tables to the front and a split level beer garden to the right hand side.

Amusingly there were two old codgers on one of the tables outside who took great delight in telling everyone they were deaf, despite talking at what seemed like a normal volume.

Nice pub in a nice setting, especially when you get the weather." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
