[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/63702/" title="Built in the so-called Kensington Italianate style in the mid-19th century, this is very much a local North Kensington institution on the border with Notting Hill which, closed for several years, came perilously close to being converted but reopened earlier this year.
This was a former Irish pub which in earlier years had been a focal point for the Notting Hill race riots of 1958 but earlier still, it was the local boozer for Timothy Evans and John Reginal Christie, of 10 Rillington Place infamy, the street being just a couple of hundred yards from here. Other past drinkers included Oswald Mosley and as a music venue, it has hosted the likes of Tom Jones, The Clash, Thin Lizzy and The Jam.
It had in recent years been gentrified, but the reopening has seen even greater change. Out front, where once the windows were reinforced with wire, are now large clear picture windows, topped with smaller panes retaining their etching. Gone is the Cannon Brewery logo to the corner splay along with the Taylor Walker plaques and lanterns; the Double Diamond logo to the entrance has also gone.
Inside, and it’s a typical traditional meets modern madeover London pub. Large, with a new boarded floor with tiled apron to the bar which appears to be new, the illuminated Double Diamond and Skol wording gone, but visible above the top of the bar parapet along with the name of Ind Coope. The overall colour scheme is dark green with a white punctuated ceiling and some Anaglypta to where the walls feature dado rails. Otherwise, there’s oxblood studded vinyl banquettes to the periphery below the windows. Some tall round tables and matching stools occupy the centre, along with a couple of round tables clasping the central columns. Further tables to the rear are low, square and modern with traditional chairs. Lighting is tasteful but minimal along with oil burning lamps on tables; two rather unattractive aircon units are fixed to the ceiling. There’s a dining room upstairs with new lavatories downstairs with a cubicle featuring almost clear glass panes to the door, which is something of an invasion of privacy, but is probably intended to be a deterrent to naughtiness. Jazz funk music played at really too loud a level for comfort and customers were a pleasing mix of pretty young things as well as some older more local geezers, though overall it wasn’t that busy for a Thursday, especially given how many had filled the Elgin across the road.
Service was immediate, with three ales being available in the form of a reversed clip, Landlord and Sussex Best on great form but at a painful £4.90 pint.
The KPH is certainly worth a visit if in the area though not a detour, but you’ll probably end up here prior to admiring the Elgin’s beautiful interior." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

The main bar is as many are in London; a stripped-out gin palace with high ceilings, big windows and not a huge amount else. The left bar, which was inexplicably empty, is where the high Victorian intricacies remain, including a wonderful dark wood and picked glass screen entrance…which some moron has labelled \'El Gin Bar\' ho bloody ho. Lining the far wall is a lovely set of etched mirrors and tiles inset into what looks like mahogany. There\'s also an exquisite bar back. I\'m guessing these must be listed as the upper and ceiling have, inevitably, been stripped and hipsterfied and looking pretty terrible into the bargain. Three ales were hidden away; Youngs Bitter, St Austell Proper Job and a warm Redemption Big Chief (NBSS 2) which would have been much better if anyone else was actually drinking it. Still, this one is worth a visit for the history factor. 6.5" class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
