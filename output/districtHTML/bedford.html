[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/952/" title="Up the road from The Cock, this is another two-roomer with divisions of Lounge Bar and Games Room to the left and right respectively. A little too clean and sterile for my liking in the Lounge Bar, there were a fair few in on an early Friday evening in both bars - the elders in the Lounge and younger crowd in the Games Room, dominated by the central pool table. Adnam\'s Ghost Ship, Lacon\'s Heritage with a second Lacon\'s beer (Falcon Ale) reversed. Just £3.00 for a pint of the Heritage, but server far too cool for my liking. Good to see a local boozer like this busy, but it weren\'t half loud." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
