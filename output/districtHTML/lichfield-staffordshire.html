[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/74860/" title="If it were not for the \'purple peril\' exterior paintwork, this would be a reasonable-looking country pub / restaurant.  Similarly for the over-remodelled and refurbished interior, although this hardly comes as a surprise from this chain.  Usual variety of seating / dining areas around the central servery, plus  a large beer garden for the better weather.  As sods law would have it, they stopped serving food at 19:00 for staff training on the evening I arrived, but thankfully the manager took pity on a weary pilgrim and sold me a pint of Doom Bar (£3.15, and the only beer available from the three handpumps) before they shut completely." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
