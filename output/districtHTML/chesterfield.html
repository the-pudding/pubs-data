[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/6937/" title="The refurbishment here has been nicely done, though the interior of this pub is a little complicated, especially for such a plain, four-square building. The bar has an impressive eight hand pumps (see photo), with half of the beers being from Ashover Brewery. I was just pondering the likelihood of keeping that many beers in top condition in an out-of-the-way place like this, when a previous customer came back into the pub from the beer garden, saying his beer was not right. It was instantly changed and the pump clip turned around, but I couldn\'t help wondering how much of the barrel would now have to be thrown away. (I picked up a rumour later in the year that all is not well with this brewery, and I hope that this pub venture is not proving to be more of a hindrance than a help.)
