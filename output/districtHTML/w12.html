[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/62479/" title="Formerly a dull O\'Neills outlet, this place has now been remodelled into something rather more appealing.  There is now a wide range of seating areas all around the elongated island bar, with fairly dark decor (apart from the bar-back) and a variety of furniture ranging from lounge tables with sofas to booths and high tables with stools.  Hosts regular live music on a small stage in one corner.  On this visit I found Doom Bar, Pride, Proper Job, Hare & Hedgehog from Oakham and Robinsons Blonde, James Blonde (£4.30) available from the five handpumps.  Still as handy for the Empire as it ever was, and not a bad spot for a pre-gig pint." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/68391/" title="Large multileveled pub located in the south terrace of the Westfield shopping centre in a line with all the other restaurant outlets serving the throngs of shoppers. The main bar is on the ground floor and this now has three beers from the Youngs stable since the purchase of Geronimo by Youngs and alongside Youngs Ordinary and Special was a very passable Winter Warmer.
The second level has a smaller serving area with two hand pumps, but we carried on further up to the top floor as here there is a room at the back with a sizeable tele for the sport and the Bull scored as one of the few locations in the Westfield Centre where I could catch the rugby being shown.
It was duly very busy on a Saturday afternoon and its very location means it will always be an eclectic mix of gangs of shoppers (largely female), or assorted males who have managed to escape and hide from the hell of shopping in the Bull. Therefore its not going to be a traditional pub experience, but then that’s not its brief." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
