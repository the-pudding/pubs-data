This looks like a proper old fashioned pub from the outside and the partially frosted glass made it difficult to see in so I wasn\'t really sure what to expect.  On entering you find yourself in a room that looks more like a coffee bar and there is a coffee machine on the counter, but there is a door to the right which takes you into the \'proper\' bar with the more pub like fixtures and fittings, including four hand pulls for real ale, though only two of these were clipped, offering Wainwright or Navigation Rebel.  I went for the Rebel at a very reasonable £1 for half a pint.

It was quiet at lunch time and I was the only customer in.  The service was friendly and my drink was topped up without me having to ask.  It looks like the bar has original features with dark wood panelling with built in mirrors, bell pushes, banquette seating and an old fireplace.  It\'s nice and clean and tidy and better than you would expect from the outside.

There are two TV screens showing BBC News.  One chap came in and asked if the TV could be changed over to the cricket.  The barmaid asked if he would like a drink first while she sorted it but he said no, not until the cricket is on.  The barmaid then had to faff about trying to find the right channel which involved various trips upstairs as that is where the equipment is housed that controls the TVs.  She couldn\'t manage it in the end, what she could see upstairs was not being reflected downstairs, so the guy left but he at least had the decency to thank her for her time.  It was mildly amusing but slightly strange to witness.

It could do a bit better on the real ale front but I can\'t fault the service and the barmaid was pleasant and friendly.  Not many pubs in the immediate area seem to do real ale so it is worth a look in my opinion." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

Nicely decorated pub with quite a pleasant feel to it. It\'s one room but with a couple of different areas. It was very quiet though on my Friday evening visit in complete contrast to its near neighbour the Hark To Towler which was packed. There\'s no real ale here, so I had to have a half of fizz. I hope it gets busier later, otherwise it\'ll be another pub lost." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
