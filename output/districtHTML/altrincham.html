[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/59324/" title="The Old Market Tavern is still open, but sadly has gone right downhill and is currently a shadow of its former self.  11 hand pulls at the bar, with a paltry one in use last night, offering up Jennings Cumberland.  Even my mate who is a lager drinker struggled to find something to drink and eventually settled on the Grolsch, which was not obviously available as the tap had a hand written sticker over it.

There was no atmosphere at all, though that said it was a Tuesday evening so not prime drinking time, though there was a small group of what I would assume to be regulars round the far end of the bar.

Overall it just feels a bit neglected.  Lights with bulbs blown, others with bulbs that are cool white in the same fitting as warm white bulbs, and the furniture just didn\'t seem to fit in with what is an old traditional building.  In the raised area the TV had been taken off the wall but just left propped up on its end against the wall.  There was a broken curtain pole with tape round it propped up.  One table had a dusty bowl half filled with pot pourri.

In its current form the pub just oozes sadness.  There is a lot of potential here to make it a great pub in a lovely old building." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/59902/" title="A busy and lively town pub opposite the rail and bus station, the exterior still retains an appearance of former grandeur which is nowadays a façade only. Inside has been effectively opened out with the bar in the central area on a back wall with the pub expanding to either side. Stained glass upper windows plus a similar internal ceiling light are of interest as are the coloured tiled squares in the floor in front of the bar.  I also noticed a vintage clock with the town\'s name misspelt with a \"g\" replacing the \"c\", this is likely to be on display for this reason, the erroneous spelling being a well known irritant to townsfolk.
A side room with a fully glazed wall with doors facing a patio drinking area has a pool table and I believe there is a dart board too but I didn\'t see it. A number of TVs were showing the Saturday lunchtime live football.
