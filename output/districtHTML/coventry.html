[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/38263/" title="This pub is signed from the main road through Balsall Common and we\'d meant to look in for decades of passing this way. It\'s as described by JAQPTIO below, an old shell with a much knocked around interior, designed for the family dining market.  When we arrived, on a dismal June afternoon, one family had finished dining and were making to leave.  And that was it. No other customers and not a single staff member visible.

We hung around for five minutes or so waiting for someone to emerge but the Marie Celeste situation persisted. And it was freezing cold, colder in than out and out was 12C. There was muttering in the ranks about the general hopelessness of it all and thus we passed on the chance to sample the mundane beer selection and Marstons did themselves out of a tenner." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
