[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/23681/" title="There\'s no real ale here - a half of Guinness was £2.50(!). There was no sign of any food on Wednesday afternoon.   

This pub looks really nice from the outside, with its double fronted bay windows and hanging baskets covered in flowers, but unfortunately it\'s a different story inside. There was a handful of blokes at the bar, seemingly taking it in turns to go out the front to smoke. It\'s an ordinary pub. There are two or three tall tables/tall stools at the front bar area with a couple of normal tables and chairs. A room at the back behind the servery has a pool table and more tall tables/tall stools, and some attractive herringbone parquet flooring. I suspect that customers come here to drink, rather than to enjoy comfortable surroundings, and there\'s nothing really wrong with that. 

But this pub doesn\'t really have much going for it for me - apart from the seats at the front facing west to catch the dying rays of the sun before it escapes behind the houses on the other side of the road. I doubt whether I\'ll return." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/23620/" title="Date of visit: 29th January 2019.

Recently reopened after the sort-lived Cured which replaced the short-lived Hop & Berry which was formerly the Barnsbury after having been Hourican\'s before it was the Windsor Castle, rebuilt in 1937 by Charrington\'s but having existed here in some form since at least the mid-19th century.
Not a great deal seems to have changed since the last incarnation with either pale grey or dark green walls with the central field panelled bar with its metal top, above which are a few glass and steel hanging receptacles; the white tiled bar back seems to have been retained from the earlier incarnation.
The floor is bare boarded and there\'s some attractive 50%- or 75%-height wood panelling. Overall it works quite well, though the interior is lacking in décor and the metal trunking to the overhead lamps is something of an eyesore. The furniture too is none too dainty, being rather industrial. There was also a log burning stove which is something, but an open fire is so much more appealing. You can tell this is a pub for hipsters as there is table football. A secondary room of sorts exists to the rear though I doubt it\'s for dining as I don\'t think the pub does food. 
Beer supply seems to revolve around so-called \'craft\' keg, with the whole selection offered on a pin board with brewer, name, ABV and price. There were though four real ales on offer: Anspach & Hobday\'s Extra Pale, Tiny Rebel\'s Cwtch, Wild Beer\'s Saaz Trek and Tiny Rebel\'s Juicy which was in good nick and £4.50 a pint though quite sweet owing to being \'tropical\'; not quite my thing but good enough.
This isn\'t a bad place and better than the Regent next door, but it\'s not really cosy enough for my tastes.

----------

A return the other night and the ambience was somewhat marred by a bloke with a very loud mouth and little children running about.
Just the one ale on: Wild Beer Co\'s Bibble and not on great form either and at £4.50 the pint." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
