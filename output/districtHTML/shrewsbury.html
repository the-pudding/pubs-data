[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/32175/" title="Under the new ownership of St Anne\'s Brewery this place has had a (slight) upturn in fortunes. On my Saturday evening visit between trains, there were flashing lights and loud music seen and heard from across the road. Once inside, I could see this place was full with the more bargain basement end of the young Saturday evening revelers with plenty shouting across the room at each other.  The good points! Three hand pulled St Anne\'s beers, which mine was excellent in spite of me not seeing them used again in my half hour visit!  Also, a portable ramp was produced to help a wheelchair user gain access to the bar area up the two internal steps. My beer, at £2.40 was very cheap for the area, obviously to compete for trade with the now more upmarket Station Hotel two doors away.
