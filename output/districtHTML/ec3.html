[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/23454/" title="The best place to appreciate the age of this pub is from the front entrance where the very well worn steps and distorted ,sloping front window attest to many centuries of use.Inside it\'s all rather Nicholson\'s chain pub,but the front section with a bench seat below said window is by far the calmest spot.The interior is long and thin,with a side opening for a long bar,while opposite a glazed dividing panel creates a mini snug below a sloping glazed roof light.At the rear is a wait to be seated dining area,with Fish House wall sign indicating the menu bias.However bar snacks can be consumed anywhere else in the interior,at what looked like reasonable prices.
Sadly the chain vibe is never far away and the muzak was much too loud and the bar was staffed with an inexperienced crew who took no notice of how long someone may have been waiting for service.
However the ale selection was decent on my trip with Nicholsons Pale,Hogs Back TEA,Doom Bar,London Pride ,Sharps Atlantic,Purity Bunny Hop,Siren Broken Dream (on top form) and a real cider from the 8 pumps.
It\'s worth a squint ,plus real ale outlets close to Aldgate are limited but not quiet enough to justify a long session here despite some historic interest." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/83418/" title="Leaving aside the fact you can\'t get, and wouldn\'t expect, real ale in a modern hotel bar such as this, I found this quite a good example of its type.  As for the name, think of bees, with the furniture, decoration and subdued lighting all in a mix of yellow / gold / orange / brown shades with some honeycomb touches.  Two of the craft beers on tap - Honey Blonde and Honey IPA (£5.50) - come from Hiver, and the fridges contain a pair of their bottled offerings too (with hives on the hotel\'s roof contributing to the honey used)." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
