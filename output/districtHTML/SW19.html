[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/24707/" title="I paid my first visit here the other day since it reopened following a major refurbishment. It\'s nothing like its previous incarnation - you wouldn\'t know it\'s the same pub. It\'s now a fair bit smaller as extensions to the original building have been removed in order to maximise the houses and flats to be built on the pub\'s land. It now has reclaimed (or possibly distressed) boarding on the floor and comprising the modern bar counter. Everywhere that brickwork can be exposed it has been exposed, and the shelving where the bar back should be is more planking supported by scaffolding. I wonder if the scaffolding here is some sort of homage to the fact that all around the pub is to become a building site when they start to build 11 flats and 7 houses on the previous pub car park and garden respectively? 

Oviously it\'s now a smaller pub than its previous incarnation - both internally and externally. instead of the pub garden we know have a few picnic benches on gravel to the side of the pub. I wouldn\'t call it a garden as there\'s nothing growing there. Furnishings inside are the usual - a couple of sofas, tall tables/tall stools, and some normal tables and chairs. I say normal, but in fact the chairs are pink plastic jobbies, just like some of the tall stools. 

But on the plus side the real ale is an inprovement. They had on Doom Bar as their regular, but they also had on Sambrook Wandle, and invariably one from the By The Horns Brewery, and at the moment it is Hopadelic at £4.50 a pint. They also had a range of keg stuff, including a couple from Goose Island, which I guess is entirely appropriate bearing in mind the Goose Island mural on one of the walls. I didn\'t see any menus during my late lunchtime visit, but I did see some food being delivered to another table. 

I don\'t care for the exposed brickwork that was never meant to see the light of day when it was put there, and which now seems to be the design feature of choice for pub refurbishments these days - but that\'s just my personal opinion and maybe other people think it looks good. But overall it\'s got the potential to be a good pub, even if I don\'t care much for these totally modernised pubs. It will be interesting to see how it gets on when it\'s surrounded by a building site." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
