[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87556/" title="A short walk from the station, but watch out for the traffic - we were almost demolished by an outsize vehicle rushing self-importantly from a side road before we even got to the busy roundabout in front of this micropub. The bar is immediately facing on entry, with five hand pumps, two of which advertise a whopping 40p Camra members discount, the other three having beer for sale. A surprise to see Abbeydale Daily Bread, a beer whose brewer we know for a fact shed copious tears over, having been instructed to create something that would taste as near to John Smiths Smooth Crap as he could make it. So we went for halves of the other two, which were in good condition: a 6.3% IPA in the modern style, and a blonde beer from Siren. We found the music here a bit distracting, though otherwise the place is pleasant enough, if you don\'t mind furniture made from scaffolding poles and cable drums. Most of the tables had been reserved for people attending the quiz later in the evening, but fortunately we were gone before that was even close to starting." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

      <p>2nd Visit - Stunning location. Lovely fires and pub furniture. Who can resist a Chesterfield.

Jaipur on draught - a first time seeing this. &pound;4.70 - so not exactly cheap.</p>
