The two internal rooms have been opened out and modernised with a few sofas dotted around amongst other various seating. There is a sizable conservatory tagged on to the pub serving as a dining area. It was very busy early evening with a predominantly 20\'s and 30\'s age group crowd. Just the two cask beers were on Sharps Atlantic and Sambrooks Jaffa.

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/24625/" title="Seven and a half years after the previous review this appears to have lost its \'two-room\' division, being a rough snorkel shape, with the bar facing the London Road entrance, standard tables and chairs in both windows, taller seating to the right with a semi-dining area out the back to the right. Half-height wood panels, bare boards throughout, despite some carpeted bits in the window areas, hops strewn on the upper reaches of the walls, old portraits, photos and paintings on the left-hand wall and movie posters on the walls on the way down to the Gents. There looks to be some wood panelling in the dining area, albeit most of it is painted over. Three Young\'s beers (Bitter, Special and Winter Warmer) joined by Adnam\'s Ghost Ship (£2.55 for a half of the Warmer, offered in a dimpled mug). I wish I\'d caught the previous reviewer\'s incarnation, but I guess what we have is progress of sorts as it was busy on a Sunday evening drop-in, despite the annoyance of some unruly small children running around." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
