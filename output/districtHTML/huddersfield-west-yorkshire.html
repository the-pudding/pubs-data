[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/56804/" title="This pub appears to have been Varsity, the Picturehouse and the Roxy over recent years, but is now called Showtime.  We included this as part of a crawl round Huddersfield a couple of weekends ago.  At the bar are three hand pulls but one of them was off, leaving just two to choose from - Little Critters Blonde Bear and Elland Dragonfly at the time of our visit, both £3.25 a pint.

I can only describe it as an industrial feel sports bar with massive TV screens showing sports.  There were also fruit machines.  It was pretty noisy despite there not being many customers in.  Not one I would be that bothered about returning to, to be honest.

I noticed on keg they had something by Magic Rock, Leffe, Lilley\'s cider and Pimms.

Bogs are clean and modern but the tiling makes you feel you are underground.  There was a CCTV camera in the gents, which I think I have only ever seen at one establishment before." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
