[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/72035/" title="Previously The Castle Green Inn, this unfortunate building is currently enduring ownership by GK and is very much a chavvy dosshole, a pity given its location.  The young staff are found from Taunton’s otherwise unemployable cadre, and are both charmless and dull.  The other drinkers and diners were fairly unpleasant too.  There is a narrow paved garden at the side.  The single room has been created by knocking out the original walls, though iron columns have been left in some places, while different flooring styles reveal the original rooms’ layout.  There is a gaming machine in the middle.  The conversion of the building was done before GK took over the pub, and it has in the past been used as a nightclub.  Four handpumps on the bar, but only one ale on – Old Golden Hen – which was in poor condition.  Food was the usual GK rubbish, only more expensive than usual.  This place currently represents very poor value for money and I really wouldn’t bother secreting myself here." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/75248/" title="Tucked away down a dead end country lane, this is certainly not an easy one to find even if you’re actively looking for it, and certainly wouldn’t get anything in the way of passing trade, other than perhaps the odd rambler. The only sign that we were even getting close was a fallen down home-made sign at the end of the lane. The landlord was very welcoming, greeting us as we arrived, waving us off when we left and much friendly chatter in between as well.

The sign outside says that it is 15th Century, and the entrance hallway certainly appeared to have some very old timberwork on the walls. The main bar was off to the right and this was quite traditional in appearance with old flagstones on the floor and many wooden supporting pillars which formed something of a partition to separate off the end of the room which looked to be more geared up for dining. An enormous stone fireplace was at one end, and next to this a small TYV which looked a little out of place perhaps, but fortunately was not in use. Several friendly old boys were sat on stools at the bar. The room to the left was broadly similar in terms of décor, with a large rug on the floor and another big fireplace with a wood burning stove. A small courtyard garden was at the front of the pub, and this was quite attractive with many rose bushes and other plants.        

Beers on tap were Doom Bar and Otter Ale, whilst the ciders were Thatcher’s Gold and Thatcher’s Haze. Overall, a real hidden gem, and well worth tracking down." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
