[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/32664/" title="A solid, traditional-looking pub, located a short distance away from the level crossing on the far side from the town centre.  The interior has been partly opened-out, leaving quite a large area around the bar and a smaller lounge beyond the fireplaces.  Much to my surprise, I found an excellent selection of real ales from the eight handpumps, with the Slack Tide stout from Titanic (£3.80) being in great form.  Good atmosphere too." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/84634/" title="A shop conversion but with a real pub atmosphere,there is a side walkway to the bar that stretches across the back wall,while seating is all traditional wooden tables,chairs and stools.There is a small log burner to the side,while a flatscreen will show Sky Sports but at a low volume.The landlady both serves and keeps a matronly eye on proceedings ,which is old school but reassuring.
The 4 handpumps were drawing Sarah Hughes Surprise,Staffordshire Black Grouse Stout,Dancing Duck Ay Up and a very decent Cross Bay Zenith IPA.Great range of styles and strengths show a knowlegeable approach to ale selection marking this out as another pub that must be visited on a crawl,and is comfortable enough for a session.Virtually opposite the Bulls Head  and a great triple header along with Hog Noggins." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
