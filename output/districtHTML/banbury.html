[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/31444/" title="Attractive Cotswold stone building, now the only remaining pub in this handsome village, a waypoint on the busy Banbury - Daventry road.  Very much the traditional layout, two rooms knocked through: the public bar to the left, fireplace and telly, the area to the right more loungey with sofas and all that.   There have been no noticeably crass refurbishments despite its Marston\'s ownership, but said ownership is sadly betrayed by much table clutter pushing the food-service menu, including daily offers - curry on Thursdays, fish on Fridays, JDW be flattered by the imitation.

And Marston\'s ownership spoils the beer range too.  Five pumps, four (yes four) clipped for Pump House, the other for Director\'s.  The Pump House was dreadful - tired, flat and tasteless, one point on the Camra scale. Everyone else, mostly local lads assembling after work for their Friday night observances, was on Carlsberg, so maybe we got what we deserved.

With different management (the staff on the ground were doing their cheerful best with the tools they were given) this could be a cracker. As it is its one saving grace is being open all permitted hours, a rarity in this sparsely populated - and thus sparsely pubbed -  area." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

Usual beams and open fires inside, a large, rather scruffy, covered terrace and garden out the back.  Majors on food, of course, but unlike too many pubs round here plenty of space for drinkers. And unlike too many pubs round here it\'s open all day, even on a Monday.

It\'s a Hook Norton tied house, but sadly the Hooky we had was a poor reflection of that brewery\'s excellent products: I fear we had the first pints out all day. Points deducted." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
