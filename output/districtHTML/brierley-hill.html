[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/53885/" title="A faux industrial era new build Marston\'s pub with non functional chimney with Banks\'s insignia.There is the bar infront of the entrance ,some circular banquettes in a front porch area,a darts board to the left opposite a small raised area with spotlights for the occasional live music.The other side has a small raised dining area,a mute flatscreen and more seating infront of exposed brick fireplace,while the first floor was roped off,but I would assume mainly for dining or private hire.Signs everywhere offering meal and drinks deals on different days but it wasn\'t working as the pub was virtually empty.
There are 4 handpumps which will offer ales from the Marston\'s stable but on my trip 3 clips were reversed while the remaining Pedigree was clear but lifeless,with an increasing woody tang as more was consumed.I failed to finish my pint,cheap at £2.75 for a reason.
No one seems to care in this chain pub and I found the \'spoons and Garrisons to be far better options at The Waterfront.One to avoid in future." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
