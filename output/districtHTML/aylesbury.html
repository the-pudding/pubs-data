[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/2091/" title="Taken over by the Oak Taverns team who were behind the successful makeover of The Cross Keys in Thame this has been turned into the go-to pub in the large village of Haddenham. As noted below, XT have adopted this as their brewery tap, so of the six handpumps, XT 3 and 4, Animal Fox and Hop Kitty were XT-related along with two beers from Magpie (Hoppily Ever After and Thieving Rogue) from their brewer exchange programme (both Magpie beers were excellent) along with their keg Eisbar as a fizz alternative. This was well-populated on my Monday evening visit, with the hubbub of local drinkers drowning out the barely-audible background muzak. This is a brisk 5- to 10-minute walk from nearby Haddenham & Thame Parkway on the Chiltern main line and is definitely worth a look-in if in the area." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/2060/" title="As noted by a previous reviewer, this village pub - now the only one left in the village, is located on a triangular village green with a refurbished and functioning windmill and old market cross at its head. Two-roomed, a sunken snug is given over to dining with a main bar given over to the noble art. A former car park to the pub\'s left now houses a tea room and seating out front. A five ale line-up (all local) comprised three Hook Norton brews - Hooky, Hooky Gold and Hooky Mild and two from Vale - Best and Feel The Need. The Mild and Feel The Need both excellent. Arriving here at around 14:30 from a walk from nearby Oving, we timed this perfectly as not only did the kitchen bring out a huge dish of roast potatoes and parsnips for us and the friendly locals to attack, the tea room, which closed at 15:00, brought out a raft of unsold sandwiches for people to take away for free. A board above the bar showed that plenty is on here including Pizza Night, Quiz Night, History and a Paranormal Investigation evening(!) They do have a habit of adhering strictly to closing times as they close during the afternoon, so make sure you time your visit accordingly." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
