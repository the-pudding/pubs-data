[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87682/" title="I agree with Delboy below, as l am also a big fan of Fixed Wheel beers and have visited their Brewery Tap in Blackheath, along with their Wheelie Thirsty micro pub in Lye. We visited this micropub last Friday and had a very enjoyable visit. There were six handpumps, serving five Fixed Wheel beers and their guest beer was Oakham Inferno. On arrival I went for the meal deal, which was a pint of stout, cob and a packet of crisps for £5.50. They also had a choice of 17 beers and ciders from a bank of taps, down the right hand side wall of the bar. 
The interior décor was quite similar to their micro in Lye, with a reclaimed pine timber bar area, some timber cladded walls and cream painted walls. This former Midland Bank is a good size with two rooms, knocked into one, plus an outside patio seating area along the front. Good beer, friendly and efficient service at the bar and friendly locals, well worth a visit in my opinion." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
