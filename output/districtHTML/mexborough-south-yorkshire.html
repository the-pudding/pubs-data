Much smarter than most micropubs, it\'s aimed not so much at real ale drinkers as young people who want to appear fashionable. There\'s only one hand pump, and most of the beers are from Thornbridge. I noticed a tendency to tropical fruit flavours and coconut in the featured beers (see photo of blackboard), which may well float someone\'s boat but unfortunately not mine. My half of Thornbridge Sequoia, my least favourite beer from my least favourite among the popular modern brewers, was uninspired and lifeless, though admittedly cheap at £3 per pint. We went and sat at a table in the beer garden out front, which had the merit of removing us from the vicinity of the execrable decor and the equally obnoxious music, but with the downside of an increased chance of dying in a road traffic accident. We were prepared to take that risk." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
