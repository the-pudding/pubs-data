[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/67131/" title="Pretty good airport Spoons in the South Terminal, past security. Named after the racecourse that was here prior to the airport. Looks to have been recently done-up, and to a high standard as well. It’s long and narrow but there is plenty of space plus there’s a skylight which helps bounce some light off the attractive copper leaf ceiling. Also liked the little copper tanks above the ‘craft beer’ bit at the bar. Three non-standard ales in Exmoor Hold, Dark Star Hophead and Oakham Citra (NBSS 3). Much more expensive than your regular high street Spoons but cheap in comparison to offerings elsewhere in the airport and they also take the CAMRA 50p vouchers so effectively you are drinking your pint for a normal ‘pub’ price, can’t knock that really. Good service too, a cut above the norm; we had three separate enquiries by different staff as to whether everything was good. An enjoyable start to my holiday and it’s worth making time to get a pint in before your flight based on this visit. Score based on context – a worthy 7." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
