Split into a three roomed pub in 2000 from what was a single room place with a tiled entrance corridor to all three areas. The main bar has swirly gold and black carpet, large windows with heavy drape curtains, brown flock wallpaper and an impressive lincrusta ceiling. To the right rear is a wood panelled snug room. Nice mix of punters from the theatre types to manual labourers via office types on a liquid lunch. Dart board in situ and there’s also a rear garden, a central London rarity. Cask OBB available. Went for the Taddy Lager, which was fine. I rather liked this one and could have settled in for a session." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
