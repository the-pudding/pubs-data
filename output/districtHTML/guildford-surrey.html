[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/57404/" title="A large and rather dignified village pub, tastefully furnished and nicely kept. Two big rooms have almost a baronial feel, with lots of woodwork and antique-style light fittings. The bar is at one end and the place is mostly laid up for dining, but there is still plenty of room for drinkers including a couple of nice leather sofas. A conservatory to the rear can be used for private dining and there is a large tabled, shrubby garden at the rear leading down to a river. Draught ales were Hog\'s Back TEA, Courage Best and Doom Bar. Note there is much car parking down the side of the pub which is not very well signed." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
