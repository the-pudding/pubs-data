[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/86246/" title="The name tells you all you need to know about what is presumably a converted cinema, with the large first-floor space devoted primarily to pool (with nine tables) and darts (three boards).  There are also a number of sports TV screens in the corner bar area, but I was still surprised how much business the place was doing on an otherwise quiet August Tuesday evening.  No real ale, unfortunately, with the keg Greene King IPA and Sharp\'s Atlantic (£1.80, half) noted amongst the routine offerings from the shiny taps." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/86219/" title="Town-centre brew-pub in a micro-pub size converted shop, with a few small tables squeezed in beside the brewing equipment and a compact counter (and one more chair can be found at the bottom of the staircase leading up to the toilets!).  Traditional furniture but more modern lighting.  Just two of the four handpumps in use on a Thursday evening, and none of their own beers were available, so the choice was Quantock Titanium (£3.20) and Beowolf Dark Raven.  I suspect that I was just unlucky on my visit, so apart from that this is a decent little place." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
