[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/19280/" title="This place has gone down in my estimation since my visits a few years ago. On entering, there was a strange smell, of long-unwashed socks in a kit bag, or a male changing room, something unsavoury anyway. Service was not as good as when I\'ve been here at busy times, and I wasn\'t as impressed with the five beers (on eight hand pumps) as on previous visits. And why are they charging over £4 for a pint (£2.05 for a half of fairly ordinary Tirril Nut Brown Ale 4.1%) when it\'s less than £3 for a slightly stronger beer at the Cornerhouse, five minutes walk away? I went and sat outside to avoid the smell (I hope it\'s only temporary); I\'ll be back before long, and hope things are not going permanently downhill.
