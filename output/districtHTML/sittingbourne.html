[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87657/" title="A micropub which opened in late 2018 in former shop premises, it is named after a type of brick which was manufactured in the nearby former brickworks.  It consists of a single room bar with a servery in the corner, and there is a small garden at the back mainly used by smokers.  There are a few tables and chairs, but mainly it’s vertical drinking.  There is a TV screen on the wall but this was switched off.  The landlady and landlord were very welcoming, and they kept the bar open long after their advertised hours (they normally close at 8pm)  as we were having a good time.  They try to source their ciders and beers locally.  On this occasion there were two ales from Mad Cat, a stout from Iron Pier, another bitter and 5 ciders from Duddas Tun.  We tried all the beers and needless to say they were in excellent condition.  It’s well worth a visit for its ale and ciders and forms a good complement to Donna’s at the other end of the High Street." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/16889/" title="Attractive pub on the small, triangular village green that was rescued as a community local in 2017 after it was closed by Shepherd Neame.  The four seasonal murals on the frontage have been redone, and the \'L\'-shaped interior has been completely refurbished in a light, semi-modern style.  On a Sunday lunchtime, most of the tables were laid up for dining, but a couple of family groups just having a drink were seated near the bar and there are also some stools along the counter.  A beer garden can also be found to the rear.  I found two of the three handpumps in use, dispensing the \'house\' Kentish Bitter (from Tonbridge Brewery) and Wantsum Montgomery (£3.60), with several other clips for local real ales in a variety of styles on the bar-back which suggest a good rotating line-up." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
