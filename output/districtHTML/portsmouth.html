[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/13564/" title="It was heaving in the Froddington Arms with a boisterous karaoke crowd when I visit on a recent Friday evening. The karaoke was set up around to the left of the bar where a dartboard and pool table are located. I didn’t venture over this side of the bar, which is why I missed the bank of five hand pumps. No problem though as I was on the Amber Nectar! Plasma screens for showing live sport are located throughout the pub. Out the back is a beer garden. I’m not a fan of karaoke so wouldn’t return on a Friday night, but I would pop in to have another look if passing at another time." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
