[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/83122/" title="A pleasing brick Victorian industrial outbuilding,this is the brewery tap for Lymestone.There is a bar to the right and a couple of high tables,the main body of the interior is to the left and winds around to a snug area around a corner ,with draughtmans designs on the walls.The interior has industrial style carpet squares and the whitewashed walls give quite a stark finish although the furniture is mixed yet traditional.Through a corridor is a rear beer garden ,while to the front there is a paved area with benches.
It has a friendly local boozer atmosphere ,and was busy on a Thursday evening with lots of regulars popping in and then out again.There is a mix of ages and being dog friendly a lot of mutts had brought their owners along for a pint.No muzak,machines or flatscreens and lots of chatter give this a micropub feel but it is large enough to be fairly described as a Tap.
There are 7 handpumps offering 6 from Lymestone ,on my visit Stone Fired,Stone Cutter,Stone the Crows,Ein Stein,Foundation Stone (well kept £3.05) and seasonal Stonefish MILD with a further handpump dedicated to a real cider.Artisan gin was proving popular with the ladies and I noted food available at some lunchtimes.
Lymestone are a decent brewer but not in the Premiership IMHO ,so although this is the place to try their ale,the longish walk from town may need to be born in mind.It is however quite close to the station.Not quite in the same league as  the other two GBG entries for Stone,The Swan Inn and the Royal Exchange but pleasant enough ." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/68728/" title="A large 19th Century house which has previously been a village shop and post office, it has been extended and now has a strange mixture of internal styles that feels a bit odd.  This isn’t helped by the atmosphere – or lack of it – when you walk in.  Three people walking in and asking for beer and food was, apparently, a bit of a strain on resources and a surprise to boot.  The main bar area is friendly enough, while the more modern dining area was a bit cold and echoey.  The staff did their best, but ti all seemed a bit confusing.  Ordering food, we were told many of the items on the large laminated menus were off, but the food we did get was plentiful, well-cooked and enjoyable.  It was all basic pub grub, and the prices were reasonable.  Ales on were Marston’s Pedigree, GK IPA and Old Golden Hen, all in fair condition.  I’d be happy enough to come back next time I’m in the area." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
