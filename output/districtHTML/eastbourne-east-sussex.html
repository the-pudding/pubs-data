A good traditional interior which is unchanged from previous reviews and is as described below, it was a bit quiet on our mid week visit, with just a couple of old boys in but not so on the early Friday evening when we popped in when it was standing room only and quite an eclectic mix of locals including what I took to be quite a mature hen party group.
This is a Harvey’s house and the same three Harvey’s beers as per the previous reviews were on and the Armada was a very well kept pint." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/10693/" title="Wonderful pub by celebrated Kemp Town Brewery in-house architect John Leopold Denman in a revivalist Arts & Crafts style in 1928 (originally called the Railway Arms). He has two other pubs in Eastbourne, Langleys (Ex Bourne Inn), now closed and the grade 2 list Tally Ho in the Old Town. 

Once two separate bars at the front (see the doors with Private and Public Bar, plus an old off sales down the left hand side) it is now one large front bar and a small rear bar plus large dining room to the rear of that. Taken over by Charringtons when they acquired the KTB in the 1950s and the small rear bar still retains the Toby Ales signage above the bar. Many of the original fixtures and fittings plus those from the Charringtons refit are still in evidence. 

There are 5 hand pumps which on my visit were dispensing Harvey\'s Best, Long Man Best Bitter, Gun Extra Pale and American Pale Ale and Brakespear Gravity. There is a good selection of lagers etc and what looks to be a very good food menu. I would recommend a visit when next in Eastbourne. It\'s only a 10\' walk from the railway station and and even shorter walk from the pub to the seafront." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
