[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87016/" title="Good Beer Guide 2019 Entry.   More to this place than meets the eye.   At first, you think its a micro bar/offlicence.   A front room with two tables, plenty of fridges and racking selling spirits.   A bar with 8 keg and four cask that are not gravity fed from barrels.  Unusually for a micro - music :-)

But there\'s also a couple of back rooms on the way to the vaults (where the personal spirits are kept) that contain plenty of pubby furniture, providing a much better experience.

One of the better micros visited." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
