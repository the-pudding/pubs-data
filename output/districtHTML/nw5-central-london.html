Not a huge amount of seating inside, but plenty of space on the canteen-style tables out in the alleyway.  No real ale, of course, but the variety of 11 craft keg beers from a total of 13 taps would offer something of interest to all but the most curmudgeonly, and I went for the Red Lager (£4.50) which was a bit different and well made." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/54424/" title="First time to visit this pub for me and I liked this pub a lot and was suitably impressed. The main bar room with its studded yellow banquettes around the perimeter and classic and conventional tables, chairs and stools throughout is well described by the reviewer below. Then hidden out back is quite a spacious, and a bit colourful outside patio drinking area with separate areas including a couple canopied booth seating areas.
Yes there is clearly a focus on food and as becoming of modern London pub interior makeovers the kitchen is exposed behind glass at one end of the pub. Sunday roasts were prominently advertised but then the rest of the food menu seemed to be Mexican with some sort of tie up with an award winning street food vendor.
But it is an independently run establishment and the key selling point for me was more the 4 cask ale pumps and the 18 keg beer lines and the chalk beer board at the other end of the pub which detailed what was on them.
For my visit three ales were available in the shape of the New River Brewery Isle or Rye, Gorgeous Brewery Goofyhoop and Tiny Rebel Stay Puft, a very good Porter. And the Keg lines included three craft brews from Tiny Rebel and further offerings from Siren, ABC, Camden Town and Belleville. 
Live music was advertised for Friday evenings and it was very good to see the showing of the current Women’s world cup so prominently promoted as we would all agree this is an increasingly important demographic to attract into the modern pub. The projection TV (the very sensible option to permanent big screens) was not in use for my visit and I also did not particularly notice the CCTV camera screen behind the bar. But if I had had done I would have taken comfort in the fact that this is a pub management that clearly takes the safety and security of its customers and their possessions seriously.
Apart from my pint of stout being at slightly exorbitant Hampstead level prices , I didn’t find a lot not to like here." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
