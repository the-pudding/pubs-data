[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/83881/" title="A very neat and lively micropub that is Rochdale\'s first. Loads of brewery stuff around the walls and ceiling. Very busy on my Friday, early evening visit. A couple of regulars moved so I could get to the bar and I ended up chatting to them. Five handpumps on the bar with a regular ale rebadged for them by Paul at Pictish along with 4 changing guests. My pint of choice was Tiny Rebel Juicy, which was so good I had a second one. A very friendly and comfortable bar, I\'ll be back here soon." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/56049/" title="The Brownhill Hotel is located just North of Rochdale town centre, through a housing estate. This pub, with large picnic lined grass covered beer garden at the rear, is one of the many Samuel Smiths in the area. The central bar on the rear wall is flanked by seating to the left and a room with seating, pool table and dartboard to the right. I paid my £1 for half an OBB, only available on keg, and hid in the pool room. I started writing some notes on my phone, but the eagle-eyed governor spotted me and apologetically asked me to put the phone away due to SS communication device rules. He explained the Mr Smith was on his rounds and I had just missed him. This explains the jitters! To be fair the governor was very friendly, and I would have no problem returning here for another quiet beer." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
