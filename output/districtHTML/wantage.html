[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/31894/" title="Another Oxfordshire re-opening - this roadside pub had been closed for a number of years. Resurrected by Star Pubs, it\'s had the obligatory country pub makeover, but is none the worse for it. The Carpenter Gothic facade remains with a grey paint job and there\'s a mishmash of styles inside. Three ales were all nationals - Fuller\'s London Pride, TT Landlord and Wychwood Hobgoblin Gold - a pint of the latter £4 and decent enough. A couple of screens showed an England ODI and A BT Sport programme respectively, both on mute, with some random muzak in the background, which bizarrely included Madonna\'s \"Dear Jessie\". A fair few in during this visit, so a welcome return of what seemed a lost cause." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

This is now in the hands of the small pub company Oak Taverns which also owns the esteemed Cross Keys in Thame. Still darkly-lit inside, this has a bar located against the left-hand wall up couple of steps from a lobby-type room with ample seating. Six ales including four locals (Animal / XT Dragon, Little Ox Oddbod, Thame Hoppiness, Loose Cannon Gunner\'s Gold as well as Titanic Plum Porter and Wadworth Treacle Treat) - pints of the Animal, Little Ox and Titanic were all excellent. As mentioned below, this was dying as a pub (I visited about year before Quinno, and my visit was exactly as he describes), so it\'s a great turnaround. A hard ask to compete with the renowned Shoulder of Mutton over the road, but this is decent way to go about it. Also, there were four boxes of real cider for the appleheads, and the beer garden out back is a nice spot too." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
