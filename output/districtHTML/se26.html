[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/24323/" title="A pub has stood on this site for around 300 years, or at least it had until 2012, when some unscrupulous property developers illegally demolished this place with the view of building new flats on the site. A local campaign and prosecution by the council helped to halt the development and forced the developers to rebuild the pub - a feat finally achieved in February 2018, six years after the place was knocked down and a full decade since it pulled its last pint. The new building is an impressive affair, replicating the pub\'s original design and layout, but presented in a high-spec, contemporary fashion. You enter past a patio seating area of dubious appeal due to its proximity to a busy roundabout, into the main bar area with the servery directly opposite along the rear wall. The bar has a nice traditional counter and well stocked bar back and has a series of high tables and stools arranged opposite, most of which were taken up by a large party during the course of our visit. the pub opens out to the left, where a spacious seating area, used more for diners in the evenings, can be found. This space is filled with regular tables and chairs and has a nice feature window at the far end which looks out towards the aforementioned roundabout and is good for a bit of people watching. The walls here have been decorated with a few nice old pictures including some of the pub in is pre-demolished state. Also of note are a few sections of original tiling which were thankfully salvaged from the only wall that wasn\'t initially knocked down, now appearing on the rebuilt front wall. The fixtures and fittings are all very smart and befitting a pub that perhaps leans a little towards the dining end of the spectrum, without really compromising too much on that crucial \'pubby\' feel.
There were four handpulls on the bar, all operational when we arrived, presenting us with a choice of Dark Star Hophead and American Pale Ale, Taylor Landlord and Adnams Old Ale. I tried the APA, which was in god shape and my father also enjoyed his pint of the Old Ale. The staff here were very friendly and helped us secure a table on a remarkably busy Saturday evening. We enjoyed a meal here to and whilst the proices are maybe a little steeper than you\'d expect for this part of town, we al enjoyed our dishes very much and had no real complaints.
This is a great story of a pub seemingly lost forever being resurrected at the cost of greedy developers and deserves to be well supported on those grounds alone. The pub presents itself well and whilst it may feel a little to food oriented for some, I still think you could settle down for a session here quite comfortably. A great addition to Sydenham\'s ailing pub scene and I look forward to a return visit sometime soon." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/83441/" title="Following on from their successful bars in Gipsy Hill, Brockley and Peckham, this is the fourth South London pub from the Penge based Late Knights Brewery. As with these aforementioned bars, this is a simple shop conversion set in a former bookmakers. The single room is pretty narrow and has a very basic servery on the left hand wall with a row of tables and plastic chairs down the right hand side. The concrete floor has been left bare and the walls have been painted in grey and red shades. Once past the bar, the pub smartens up a little, with a pleasant seating area centred around a couple of low tables which are served by some well worn armchairs and rickety old chairs and stools. Shelves back here hold board games, books and various bits of Late Knights merchandise and a group of people were engaged in a boisterous game of cards in one corner of the room. There was a lot of bunting hung around here, the ceiling had some rather nice retro patterned tiles and one wall was decked with a string of empty beer bottles, all of which combined to make this quite a pleasing, cosy little spot to relax and certainly a lot more comfortable and homely than anything you\'ll find in their other local pubs. To the rear there is an open kitchen which, on this visit, was operating as a pop-up venue, with proceeds on my visit going towards the restoration of the South London Theatre in West Norwood. A chilled soundtrack played throughout my Friday evening visit and there was a good crowd of people in, without it getting uncomfortably busy. 
Cask ales here are served straight from the barrel, thanks to stilage to the left of the bar. Options on this visit were Late Knights Crack of Dawn and Morning Glory plus Brighton Beer Vermont IPA (£3.80) and Mino English Bitter. The keg taps had four Late Knights brews and four cider and perry options and the friendly bar staff were happy to talk through the different styles and merits of each beer and offered tasters where appropriate. I tried both Brighton Beer brews plus a keg stout from Late Knights. The beer quality was a bit variable, with the Mino English Bitter probably in the best condition.
I quite like the bars opened by this small chain, without really loving any of them. I find them quite nice, buzzy places with a good vibe and more often than not, good beer. This one seemed a bit more fully realised than some of their other bars and perhaps hints towards a progression for future bars. Sydenham isn\'t an obvious destination for the pub-goer, so this place is a definite boon for the local drinking scene." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
