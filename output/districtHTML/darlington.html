[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/54901/" title="I was beginning to despair of Central Darlington until we found this excellent pub hidden down an alleyway just behind Binns. There is one very atmospheric bar with a superb range of beers and enthusiastic staff. The tiny Mad Scientist brewery is located in the cellar and their beers can only be found here (not to mention the brewers!), while upstairs is a function room which hosts occasional live music and other events.
