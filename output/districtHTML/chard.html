[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/56792/" title="A very interesting roadside pub dating from the 15th Century, originally called The Culverhay, and still a Hall and Woodhouse house.  There is plenty of parking, yet the grounds have retained a pleasant walled lawn, and a rather scruffier children’s play area which is comfortably remote from the pub itself.  There are also seating areas for smokers.  The interior rambles, the floors are uneven, the ancient architecture visible in many places.  On arrival we were greeted by an unusually grumpy greyhound, though the landlord was much more welcoming and fairly chatty.  Food was basic pub grub at low prices, but it was more sustenance than enjoyable eating.  Three Badger beers on, Fursty Ferret, Pickled Partridge and Badger Best Bitter.  We had pints of Best, and the landlord was kind enough to give us a free taster of Pickled Partridge, and the beer was in pretty good condition.  Very happy to poppe inne for a pint next time I’m passing though I wouldn’t eat here." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/32916/" title="A 17th Century hotel, allegedly haunted, currently owned by Star Inns.  The car park is at the back, there is a small beer garden and a smoking terrace at the side, adjacent to the car park.  As you enter from the High Street you pass through a small open area with a pool table on the left and a small snug on the right.  The main bar is further in, past a pair of gaming machines.  It’s a comfortable square room formed from two earlier rooms.  The larger of the fireplaces – an enormous inglenook – is now the main fireplace, and there is a large TV screen which was showing daytime TV when we visited.  A large beam above the inglenook has the date 1644 carved into it.  There is also a screen and projector used to screen live sports matches.  There is a skittle alley at the back which is used as a function room and is reached via a corridor with a piano in it.  The young barman was sociable and friendly and the atmosphere was calm and welcoming.  Three handpumps on the bar were dry, although Adnams Ghost Ship was available direct from the barrel and was in good condition.  Definitely worth including in a crawl." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
