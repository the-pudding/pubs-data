No problem finding a table but, as the focus seems to be on food, several tables had reserved notices on for later in the evening. No real surprises there and no problem for us as it was a fairly swift stop.
I enjoyed the leather Brooks saddles used as coat hangers.
Beers on were predominantly Purity: UBU, Pure Gold, Mad Goose and Bunny Hop all doubles up as I recall. Guests were Roosters Baby Faced Assassin and Kirkstall Three Swords. 
Everything we tried was in very good shape and the Baby Faced Assassin vied for beer of the evening.
I\'d happily return for what seems to be a guarantee of good beer." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/37668/" title="Block-like estate pub (now called in Hobsons Choice again) in a dismal little parade of shuttered shops, and initially seeming closed down as all the curtains on the two-storey lounge side were drawn.  However, lights were on in the public bar so I ventured inside to find a simply furnished and plainly decorated room dominated by a pool table but also having plenty of space for the dartboard.  No real ale, of course, do went for the keg M&B mild which didn\'t break the bank at £2.60.  Having said that, I would add that while one might hesitate entering a place like this as a rare and random stranger, I found the landlady welcoming and regulars friendly, so my visit exceeded my (admittedly low) expectations considerably." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
