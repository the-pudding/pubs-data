[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/12509/" title="This is a Cotswold stone pub in the tourist trap village of Bibury. Formerly two 15th century stone buildings that were put together to make the pub these can still be seen in the three rooms that surround the central serving area. The larger dark beamed dining room extending out the back is a much more recent addition. 
The main bar section with the hand pumps is in the main room into which you enter and then the two smaller rooms are to the left and back right to this one with the modern dining room addition to the right of the main bar.
Its independent and family run and we experienced very friendly service levels, although due to its tourist trap location they do expect you to come here to eat, so the first question you get asked is “how many are there of you for the restaurant”. But no problem if all you want is a beer and once this was established a fitting round table in the main bar room was cleared for us.
There are four hand pumps on the bar which had on Hook Norton Hooky, Otter Bitter, Froth Blowers Piffle Snonker and Cheltenham Gold from the local Cotswolds Goffs Brewery, although we had just missed the Otter and it was reversed. So a slight negative that we were left with three golden ales but between us we tried all three and they were well kept, so we will forgive the pub that.
We found this to be a solidly run traditional village pub and long may it remain so." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/62361/" title="The bar of this four star ivy clad hotel with its prominent position in the cotswold tourist trap village of Bibury is open to non residents .  The Swan bar is modern and comfortable but is what it is and therefore has all the ambience of an airport waiting lounge. Usual keg offerings from the small bar which did have two hand pumps although only one was in operation dispensing a just about passable Deuchars IPA. Probably convenient if you are staying here but fortunately the Catherine Wheel at the top of the hill provides a much better pub experience." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
