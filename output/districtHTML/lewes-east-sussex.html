[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/11017/" title="The building itself isn\'t anything particularly remarkable but the setting catches the eye with the pub backing on to white chalk cliffs.
Inside as noted before is quite quirky, a quality I quite enjoy in a pub, plenty of oddments on the walls and hanging from the ceiling, the bar front boldly painted would not look out of place on a narrow boat and indeed there were a couple of knitted dolls of Rosie and Jim sat on a nearby piano. Seven handpumps and beer line up much more up my street than the bulk of Harveys dominated Lewes,Five beers were on from Siren, Pig & Porter , Gun, Wild Beer and Burning Sky, the Aurora from the latter was a decent drop.Certainly a pub worthy of returning to." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/11012/" title="Grade 2 listed building in the wonderfully rural village of Firle, nestling at the foot of the South Downs. Small bar area but has a public bar room on the left and the games room to the right (mind your head on the low door frame) which still has an old Toad-in-the-Hole game. There is also the Functions Room (the Old Court House Room) to the rear of the public bar room too plus rooms in the old stable range to the right hand side. Since I last visited way back in 1989 it has undergone a refurbishment in 2005 which has resulted in a new paint scheme which is at odds with the rustic charms of the pub. In other words it has gone gastro! However it still sells two to three real ales (usually Harvery\'s Best plus two local brewery beers; Long Man or the nearby Burning Sky) plus one real cider on hand pump. The pub has a nice walled garden to the rear plus tables and seating outside the front. Does get very busy during the summer with walkers, hikers et all plus visitors to the nearby Glynebourne Festival during May to August (the 5 guest rooms are usually sold out)." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
