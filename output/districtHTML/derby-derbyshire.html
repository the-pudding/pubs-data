On approach, you will see the majority of the drinkers sitting out in the front of the building at tables and chairs. Some of the customers had utilised some of the infrastructure around the yard such as pallets and kegs to use as seating or to place their beers on. Once inside the building, you will find a good sized square shaped room with a rustic looking pine counter on the right hand side, serving 4 guest and 3 Shiny cask beers and 10 keg. The left hand side of the room had an extensive range of bottled and canned beers in three banks of bottle coolers. The seating arrangements in this area was pine tables and chairs. The Shiny Brewery could be seen at the back of the unit and was accessible by the staff through a curtain of plastic strips. The prices in here for their cask ales was reasonable at £3 a pint, so we went for the Furnace Brewery Brown Town, Shiny Affinity, Shiny 4wood and Shiny Happy People." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

The interior was modern with white painted walls, displaying a locals artist\'s work. The bar area positioned over on the right hand side had a black granite worktop and a reclaimed pine timber bar front. The main features in here for me was the 70s style plastic yellow coloured chairs and the wave of ceiling strip lighting, plus some ceiling mouldings.
