[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/41841/" title="The Moonrakers is a large Arkells pub with an L shaped lounge bar full of seating to the left and a large public/sports bar to the right that houses a pool table and a couple of dartboards. Plasma screens are located throughout for watching live sports. A function room is advertised (up to 300 people) and live music is also advertised. Ample parking is available outside the front of the pub and there is a covered smoking shelter. I believe there is a beer garden out the back, but I did not investigate during my recent Thursday evening visit when this pub was very busy with locals. The bar is stocked with standard draught and only one of the hand pumps was in operation, this was drawing 3B. Very reasonably priced pub grub is available.
This pub seemed to be very popular with the locals in attendance, but it is a bit of a trek from the main town for me to ever plan to visit again." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
