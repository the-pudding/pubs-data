[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/58832/" title="The Freemans Arms was probably the most comfortable of all the pubs in the Docks area. The bar, stocked with standard keg, on the right-hand wall faces open plan seating. Televisions throughout were showing Sky Sports. The sound was on, as was the jukebox so there was a bit of noise conflict. In the front left corner is a raised area with pool table and karaoke is held here every Friday evening. There is a quiz every Sunday from 18:00. This is probably the pub I would be most likely to return to if I found myself in the area again, which is doubtful." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
