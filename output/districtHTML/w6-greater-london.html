[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/22649/" title="Tucked away down a small back alley is this lovely old pub with a traditional and fairly unspoilt interior. Layout is three rooms one behind the other, leading out to a small patio garden overlooking the river. The main bar has a tight dark varnish interior, low beams, riverside prints, muted lighting and padded settles – all rather lovely. The two rear rooms are given over to dining so you need to get here at a quiet time I\'d you want a seat. Three ales on from Fuller\'s; Pride (oddly fizzy, NBSS 2.5), Oliver\'s Island and ESB. Steep prices as to be expected. The iffy beer stops it from getting the top marks it probably would have received otherwise." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
