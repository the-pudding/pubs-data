[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/37040/" title="The largest of the three remaining pubs in the village - there were five until recently - The Shakespeare ticks all the olde-worlde boxes, including a magnificent fireplace. Pity the huge sofas mean only a couple of people can enjoy it at any one time. Two distinct drinking areas, not as knocked through as it could be, plus a bolt-on conservatory for diners, and a nice garden out the back.

Purity beers dominate, three on when we called, and the Mad Goose went down a treat.

Harbury still gets a usable daytime bus service from Leamington, and a mini-crawl of the village is recommended." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

Seems to have had a chequered recent past of closures and reopenings... It\'s a simple enough single room pub, offering food and two hand pulled ales - Purity and an Xmas one from wychavon brewery.

Needs punters. Two in on a later Friday lunch time at Xmas doesn\'t bode too well." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
