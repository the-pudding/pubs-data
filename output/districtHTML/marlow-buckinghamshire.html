[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/2348/" title="Taken on by the team in charge of the nearby Grouse & Ale in Lane End and Yew Tree in Frieth this former rundown pub has had a change of name, perhaps more in keeping with Marlow\'s proximity to the Thames, although the loss of a traditional pub name is always a contentious one. Access from Spittal Street is now blocked, so you must enter from an alley to the left. The bar faces on entry with an untreated pine bar front and patterned lino bar apron. There\'s booth-style seating in front and to the left with a snug room to the right with what looks to be an original brick fireplace. A dining area with open kitchen is to the left on entry with a raised and covered patio area out back. No real ale at the moment, although I understand this will likely change in due course. Some crafty stuff on keg including locals Rebellion IPA and Lager. A pint of Beavertown Neck Oil was £5.60 for a pint\'s worth. Looks to have had a bit of money thrown at it and it should work in the long run, but until they introduce the handpumps, it won\'t trouble the Camra brigade." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

The entrance from the car park has some Olde Worlde beams and there are plenty of tables set out for dining. The bar straddles the old and new parts of the building - the latter a vaulted-ceiling conservatory-type bit. Rebellion IPA remains, augmented this time by a local ale in Chiltern Honey Porter which was excellent, albeit £4.60 for a pint. I overheard a manager-type mentioning to another customer that they get other local breweries\' ales in (Fisher\'s, W&E, West Berks) which is commendable, although still expect to be upsold - \"anything else\", etc. Score uplifted to a 6.5 to the locAle slant.

19th September 2016
A food-oriented pub hidden up a lane leading out of Marlow. Lots of young, enthusiastic, lumberjack-shirted staff bustling around and a cavernous garden to boot. The ale choice comprised Adnams Ghost Ship and Rebellion IPA, the latter of which came in at £1.90 a half. Rated 5.5" class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
