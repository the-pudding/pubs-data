[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/68555/" title="A new build \'spoons ,the interior does at least wind around and the low ceiling gives a modicom of character.You will need to push around to the semi circular glass glad seating area if you want Thames views,and this was packed with the unfit,infirm and decrepit in a scene that could easily be described as God\'s Waiting Room.The rest of the interior had mainly high tables and drinking shelves,while the bar was in a dark corner.The ale selection was the regular horror show of Doom Bar,GK IPA and Abbott and London Pride while guests were the ever awful Hobgoblin Gold and Bombardier together with Long Man Copper Hop,Jennings Snecklifter and Burton Bridge Draught Burton Ale (didn\'t taste of much).
This pub just reminds me how poor some Wetherspoons can be,unexciting guest ales,a depressing vibe and although it maybe cheap,it\'s cheap for a very good reason .Avoid." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/59614/" title="A Youngs pubco house,in a modern development but attached to an older building,the bar just seems uber trendy.There are vast plate glass windows,a lot of room for vertical drinking and just a few seats running under the window,some high tables opposite the bar,with two sofas at the end.The bar is very long,with two side staircases leading to a dining area.River views are limited although there is an external patio with wicker furniture.I noticed a drop down screen and an array of speakers high up,so I fear that the volume may get cranked up for the afterwork crowd and at other popular times.The menu is standard corporate fare,while the three handpumps were offering Youngs Bitter and Special (best avoided) with the usual guest of St Austell Proper Job in poor condition,flat and too warm.
Best avoided in future despite a cheery welcome." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
