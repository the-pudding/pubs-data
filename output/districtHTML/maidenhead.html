[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/1459/" title="An attractive looking pub in the centre of this very pleasant village, like The Hinds Head just along the road, it is owned by celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal and whilst is did perhaps have something of an emphasis on dining, it didn’t appear to be overtly so and certainly retained it’s cosy and traditional pub ambience, with a few of his books for sale behind the bar counter being the only obvious sign of it’s ownership. A jar of dog biscuits behind the bar further emphasised the fact that this is still a pub and not a restaurant.    

Internally it’s divided in to several different rooms all of which have a pleasant, “olde worlde” ambience with a low beamed ceiling, as well as several chunky supporting timber pillars. The flooring is a narrow wood strip, whilst there was dark wood panelling on the lower part of the walls with rough cream plasterwork above. Elsewhere was some pale wood panelling, and a number of old pictures of the locale, and a few portrait photographs, were dotted around the walls. A free standing, dual aspect brick chimney breast separated two of the rooms, and a real log fire was blazing away which was a nice touch during the unseasonably cold weather. A further old fireplace was off to the left, although this looked to be unused. A large brass Courage Beers sign was hanging above it. Despite it’s rustic appearance, the majority of the tables did look to be reserved for dining, and we perched on a couple of stools at the bar, where it appeared that most other non-dining punters were congregating. This was fine for us as we only popped in for a quick drink before going for a meal in Heston’s restaurant just up the road, but it would perhaps be a little uncomfortable if settling in for a longer session.      

Beers on tap were Marlow’s Rebellion IPA, Bath Ales Gem, Dark Star Hophead and Courage Directors, whilst a fifth pump appeared unused. The solitary cider was Orchard Thieves which went down very well, although the prices seemed expensive with a pint of that and an orange juice and lemonade coming in at £9. Overall, I thought this was a very nice pub and would certainly stop by again if in the area." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

      <p>Immaculate C17th coaching house. Multiple rooms, roaring fires, friendly bar staff and manager.

It was the Rebellion Brewery signage outside this freehouse that tempted me in. The IPA was in superb condition. &pound;4.40.</p>
