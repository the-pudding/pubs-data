[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/45823/" title="My review below was written on hearing the news that the pub, under the management of Marstons, had closed. It has now reopened with a new name and a fresh approach to beer and food. (See photo for beer range at the time of my visit.) I went for the Siren Undercurrent, having also tasted the other Siren beer and shunned the offerings from Vale of Glamorgan and Tiny Rebel. My companions all chose Cwtch, which I cannot stand, though clearly many people love it, as I heard no complaints. I didn\'t see any sign of the large screen they used to have (opposite the bar) for live sports being shown on TV, with the pub seemingly now aiming for slightly upmarket diners and beer connoisseurs, just a smaller one near the bar counter, but it may all change at other times of day, of course." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

I recognised the name from the 2019 GBG so thought I would give it a try. As mentioned below it\'s a smallish rectangular room with a tiled floor and the bar counter on the front left. 
There was a stack of six boxed ciders on the bar which may not be ideal in Summer. The three hand pumps had beers from local breweries although they were all around the 4% abv mark. I went for the Grey Trees Caradog\'s Bitter (£3.25) which was in good nick.
I thought this place was worth a look." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
