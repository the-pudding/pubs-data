They really do think they are something. In reality it\'s a reasonably sized bar with a restaurant area to the left. The brewing kit is in a room to the right. Loads of keg lines, but only 2 cask ales brewed using the on site kit. The seating options are all pretty uncomfortable with wooden settles and chairs or benches for the most part. They only serve beer in 1/3rds or 2/3rds for no reason that is obvious. We had one of each and it was a rip off £4.50 for a 3% ish table beer.  Been now, don\'t need to come again, although the seating on the quayside would be great in Summer." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/36262/" title="An attractive and quite large roadside pub with the fake half-timbered look that can be seen in many towns up and down the country. This one has been completely opened out inside, and, being the only pub in the village, I imagine it gets pretty busy at times. The occasion of my visit, a brief stop off at opening time on the way to Sunderland, was not one of them. I was pleasantly surprised to find a solitary hand pump on the bar, slightly disappointed to see that it was serving the (definitely not local) Robinsons Dizzy Blonde, even more despondent when it took eight or nine pulls to get my half pint into a glass, then pleasantly surprised (again) to find that it was reasonably palatable. Nevertheless, I only stayed here for as long as it took to make sure I didn\'t have to wait too long on Pelaw station for the next Metro train towards Sunderland." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
