Now, in essence, an Indian restaurant in a former pub which retains a functioning bar; the horseshoe shape remains, but the former rooms have been knocked through into one space with a light grey paint scheme predominating. Sadly, the only feature of note was what looked to be an original fireplace with tiling opposite the bar, although the stained glass \'Saloon Bar\' header also remains from a previous review. A single real ale in the token Sharp\'s Doom Bar which was pleasantly serviceable at £3.75 for the pleasure. A couple of screens showed a PL game to nobody and I was one of three punters in on a Sunday arvo until a DJ began noisily disassembling and removing gear from a booth. Another Heritage pub pretty much lost." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
