[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/22448/" title="This is a very nicely set out, open plan pub close to Kensington Palace. The single room layout has dark floorboards throughout, complimented by a smart patterned tile area around the servery. Leaded windows with stained green glass bands can be seen along two sides of the room, which has two small pillars in the centre and a fine decorative ceiling. Short banquette booths have been formed under the front windows, with long benches down the right-hand wall, standard tables and chairs through the centre and a row of high tables and stools directly opposite the bar. The servery runs down the left-hand wall and has a dark wood counter and bar back, although both have been painted in neutral colours in places, which sadly detracts from the overall look. The bar back has been adorned with all sorts of unrelated items, including old books, beer bottle displays, kitsch G&T signs and other bits and bobs, that help make it look a bit homely. There’s an impressive fireplace on the back wall, underneath a large blackboard that provided details on a Six Nations beer competition the pub had been hosting. An arch at the end of the bar leads through to a small rear space with room for a couple more tables and some horse themed pictures on the walls. Stairs lead down to a basement bar which has a limited amount of seating and its own servery, acting as a reasonable overspill area for peak times. From here, there is access to a garden which has a few picnic tables in a rather camped space.
There were four handpulls on the bar, dispensing Oakham Dragon in Bavaria, Turtle Pale Ale, Adnams Ghost Ship and By the Horns Jack the Lad IPA. These options were ably supported by a strong craft keg range which included beers from the likes of Thornbridge, Brewdog, Porterhouse and Tiny Rebel. My pint of the Dragon in Bavaria was £4.85 and in pretty good shape.
I liked the light, airy feel of this open-plan pub which mixed traditional features with contemporary styling to good effect, creating a pleasant space which seemed to have wide appeal judging by the customer base on this visit. The good cask and keg selection means this place is worthy of repeat visits and I’m sure I’ll be back here again before long." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
