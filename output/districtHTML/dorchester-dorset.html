There are three conjoin... [<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/9786/" title="Originally a Georgian coaching inn but now well off the beaten track, it’s now a very smart village pub ideal for elderly tourists who want a slice of chocolate-box Dorset without the possibility of caravans or coach parties.  There are three conjoined bar areas one of which is laid as a dining room with wooden flooring, the other two as a stone-floored drinking bar and a carpeted lounge with a small open fire.  There is a chimney open on two sides which contains a woodburner between the dining and drinking areas.  The décor is faux-rural.  There is a gravel car park and a small outside sitting area which falls short of being a proper garden.  Food is restaurant-style, almost gastro, while both food and beer prices are above average.  Ales on were Yeovil Ruby, Fine Tuned Sunshine Reggae and Copper Street Brewery’s Shield Maiden.  There was also a real cider on  draft and Orchard Pig on tap.  The staff were pleasant and today’s newspapers were available.  The ale quality was excellent, justifying a recent GBG entry.  I’d be very happy pop in for an occasional beer or relaxed meal though the prices would make me think twice if I were in a hurry." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
