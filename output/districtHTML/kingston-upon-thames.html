[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/35958/" title="Once a large pub in a prominent spot at the Hampton Wick end of Kingston Bridge, this place is now primarily a hotel but still retaining a bar for non-residents. After passing through the large front patio area, the entrance is clearly marked on a solid wooden door which leads into a smaller than expected room with the bar along a side wall. Inside the overall feel as expected is rather corporate despite some decent features such as the Tudor style leaded windows with stone mullions, a large feature fireplace and a few framed bits about the River Thames and nearby Hampton Court Palace. Beyond the bar near a reception desk hangs a long sketch plan of the Thames (or Isis) from Oxford up to Putney.
Most tables were set for food but not especially formally and there was no issue sitting if not eating. The place remains Fuller\'s branded and had Pride, Due South and Dark Star Hophead on handpump with two pumps missing clips. A perusal of the drinks menu on my table informed that Fuller\'s Imperial Stout is available in bottles, albeit at £14.15.
It\'s fine to drop in for a quick pitstop as I did after walking along the river but unless planning a meal I wouldn\'t really consider this place as a venue for an evening\'s drinking." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
