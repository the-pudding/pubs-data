[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87993/" title="A new outlet for the award-winning Grey Trees microbrewery, located just a mile away. It\'s part of the old National School building, right in the town centre. Five large tables, a few smaller ones, and an outside seating area probably qualify it as a micropub. More than fifty customers and it would be a squash. Cosy inside, with background music and a rather obtrusive TV, but no pool table or jukebox. Wide selection of Grey Trees products and guest beers/ciders as well. Plenty of scope for it to become a focal point for mature drinkers." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
