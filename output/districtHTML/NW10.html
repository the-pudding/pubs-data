Unlike the other pubs that I had been in today, this one clearly had a heating system in place that had managed to heat the place up to a habitable level. Or maybe because it was later in the day whereas the others I had visited soon after opening? Anyway, I was pleased to be able to get warm again in here. There were one or two bucket armchairs around the place, a single tall table with tall stools at which the three other customers were perched, but furnishings were mainly banquettes with normal tables and chairs. There was a pool table, TVs on showing Loose Women, and a couple of fruit machines, and that\'s about it.

There\'s a photo of the pub on one of the walls, with a note saying that it was taken in 1910 and that the pub was built in 1896. but WhatPub says the current pub was built in 1928 and I have to say that it looks more inter-war than Victorian to me. There\'s some original (grey-painted) matchboard panelling on the dado; cream painted matchboard panelling on the ceiling; and what looks like the original bar counter (now grey-painted). 

This looked to be a decent little watering hole, which would obviously be greatly improved with the provision of a decent real ale." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

There were lots of Irish accents in here, plus of course the horse racing being shown on all the TV screens. There were also some shamrocks, and Gaelic script around the place, as well as Celtic football club photographs and memorabilia and photographs of Rory McIlroy in action on the walls. It\'s carpeted, and furnished with some banquettes and normal tables and chairs. It was nice and warm in here on a cold winter\'s day. It\'s all very uncomplicated, which is a good thing obviously.

I\'ve yet to visit an irish bar that did real ale (as far as I can recall) and this one is no different in that respect. My pint of Guinness was a very reasonable £3.40. 

There was a good number of punters in during my midweek mid-afternoon visit, so it\'s cleary a going concern. This one is fine if you like these unsophisticated bars, and aren\'t fussy about the availability of real ale." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
