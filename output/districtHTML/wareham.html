[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/10113/" title="This is an old, traditional pub just off the main road through the centre of Wareham, recently reopened after a period of closure, with a smartened up interior. I drank inhere a few times in my teenage years and am sure that the pub used to have various separate rooms, but it has been opened out quite a bit now, with the entrance leading you down a short central passageway of sorts before emerging at the bar, with seating areas to either side in spaces that could well have been partitioned off in the past. The servery runs along the rear wall and has a nice traditional looking counter and plain white bar back lined with a few pump clips. The two seating areas have been carpeted and offer limited banquettes and quite a few regular tables and chairs under walls lined with typical photos of the local area, horse brasses and rural themed items. A couple of large TV screens were showing a test cricket match with the commentary audible but quite quiet. A door to the rear leads out to a two-tier patio garden with a few nice flowerboxes, several tables and sturdy garden chairs and access to the toilet block.
The new owners have installed a real ale presence, with five handpulls on the bar, three of which were operational on our recent visit, offering St Austell HSD and Proper Job and Butcombe Original. My pint of Proper Job was in good nick and the pub has made the latest edition of CAMRA’s Good Beer Guide. My parents have visited a couple of times and said the food was very good but the menu was very limited and the service wasn’t always the friendliest – something I can sympathise with, having encountered a particularly miserable barman on this visit.
I’m pleased to see this place open again and doing its best for the town’s beer scene and I thought the place was quite well presented, even if the TV screens were a bit overwhelming and the welcome was lukewarm. There are better pubs in town but this place has jumped up the pecking order and should be considered for a visit when in the area." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/10115/" title="This is a lovely looking thatched pub dating back to the 1500’s, on the main road through Wareham. The pub has more of a rural feel to it than any of the more modernised pubs in town and retains a multiple room layout. You enter into a corridor which leads you to the main bar in the left hand room, the lounge in the right hand room and a dining room to the rear. The bar area is the nicest spot for a drink, with quarry stone flooring, whitewashed walls and a low wooden beam ceiling. Seating is limited in here, with a nice fireplace taking centre stage and lots of breweriana and brassware has been put on display to distract the eye. The lounge is arguably an overspill for the dining room and has standard seating in a fairly basic space with similar decor to the main bar. We visited for Sunday lunch and therefore found ourselves in the rear dining room where more tables and chairs played host to a constant stream of hungry punters. There are more beer and brewery related items on display and a stack of board games kept the few children present occupied for the required length of time. There is also a dartboard in one corner – unplayable during peak dining hours, but I do remember playing on this board on my one previous visit 16 years ago. Out the back is a large beer garden with nice flowerbeds, some shelter for smokers and good, sturdy tables for summer eating and drinking.
There were four ales on when we arrived and I think a fifth might have come on during our stay. I tried the Butcombe Bitter which was an excellent pint and my father has visited on several occasions in the last year or so and tells me the beer is always top notch. A large collection of CAMRA awards in the main bar would seem to attest to this. The bar staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating and the food we had was pretty good too.
I’ve been meaning to come back to this place for years and don’t really know why it’s taken me quite so long. It’s a very atmospheric pub that feels like it is at the heart of the local community, whilst also providing good food and drink to outsiders like ourselves. There are a couple of great pubs in Wareham but this one probably tops the pile." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
