[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/86657/" title="Urban style micro bar, with plenty of grey painted steel work, exposed brick work and some reclaimed timber. The layout in here consisted of a mezzanine first floor, accessible from a steel frame staircase as you enter. A small compact bar was housed in underneath the overhang from the mezzanine first floor and had a reclaimed pine cladded bar front and the counter was finished in polished Ash. Four handpumps on the bar, so we went for the Chantry Brewery Kaldo Pale. This bar was ok when quiet, but couldn\'t imagine the din when it gets busy, especially when people are clattering around upstairs. We also noticed the prices for the beers, getting slightly elevated around this trendy part of town." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/33724/" title="Popular village pub and restaurant, a former 17th century coaching inn. It has a split level L-shape interior, probably best described as traditional with a modern twist. There is a stated policy to champion Yorkshire ales and on this visit three of the four on offer were brewed just down the road, in Darton. They were Nailmaker ‘Paleton’ and ‘Anvil’ and Jolly Boys ‘YPA’. The fourth being ‘School Night’ from Mytholmroyd’s Nightjar Brewery. (The Talbot is the official tap for Nailmaker beers, apparently). Quality was decent, but unfortunately, on trying them all, they were a pretty underwhelming bunch. A couple of craft beers were also on offer, including Tiny Rebel’s ‘Clwb Tropicana’. 

Absolutely rammed on our Saturday night visit, with a lively, but good natured, crowd. The three young bar staff were far too busy to engage in conversation, but service was polite and efficient. All in all, I liked it enough to call again, but would probably avoid the weekend in future. GBG 2019 listed." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
