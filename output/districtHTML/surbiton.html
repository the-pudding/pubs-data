[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/53206/" title="The Big Smoke Brewery may have moved out, but they retain a strong presence on the bar, both keg (about 12 taps to the left) and cask (10 pumps - something like that). It\'s a busy pub, and with good reason - the beer range is top-quality with the guests well-chosen (for example Ilkley and Pig & Porter on my visit); the incoming crowd pounced on my vacated seat as I left.

As well as that, there\'s a reasonably-priced menu, though the availability may not quite tally with the times quoted on the menu (as I was disappointed to discover).

All-in-all then, I\'d say The Antelope has to be a must-visit pub for anyone looking for great beer in a good pub." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/64631/" title="The former Saucy Kettle then Copper Kettle is now Wags N Tales, a curious name one might suppose. This appears to be a double fronted shop conversion, split level on the line of the former separating wall. The bar runs along one side wall, there is plenty of exposed brickwork and décor includes old tin advertisements, a wall slogan declaring \"Coffee Beer & Wine\" as well as dog pictures. There are also dog print cushions on seats and so many dog bowls on the floor there is a reasonable chance of tripping over one. I have been in many pubs that claim to be dog friendly, this is however the first one I\'ve visited that isn\'t just so, dogs are positively encouraged and are almost the target clientele. Food is served here, from the \"plant based kitchen\" so fully veggie with many vegan options, there are three menus, the main one, another for children then of course the dog menu. This includes \"Puppacino\", \"Pupcakes\" plus other stuff and treat bags are available. I suspect these may also be meat free.
My lunchtime visit found most punters to be of the non-canine variety although there were a couple outside with their owners utilising the pavement benches, the majority of customers were drinking wine or coffee. I was however slightly surprised to find that a solitary handpump offered Dark Star Hophead. No sign of Dogbolter or Newcastle Brown.
Groups of mums with babies chatted and a few solitary customers tapped away on tablets and laptops. A DJ deck in a back corner suggests that the pub may be a different thing at different times.
A novelty pub I felt but not actually unpleasant. An extra mark for having a cask ale which is a step up from either of the previous ventures." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
