[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/1892/" title="As described below by Quinno, this village pub is welcoming, friendly and much better value than some other nearby pubs.  The landlord and landlady went out of their way to make us welcome, and the locals were very tolerant of us.  There is a small car park at the front  and a pleasant terraced garden.  Inside, the three bar areas are contiguous.  The lounge area has a woodburner which creates a homely, warm atmosphere.  There was a dartboard which appeared redundant and a TV screen which was switched off.  Ales on were West Berkshire Good Old Boy, Young’s Special and Doombar.  We had a better beer experience than Quinno (below),	 all three ales being in very good condition.  Food was basic pub grub, though it seemed a bit unbalanced – a delicious home-made chicken and ham pie, incongruously complemented with thin frozen chips and packet gravy -  at a reasonable price for the area.  They also offered a range of very strong chilli sauces for the adventurous and fresh pizzas for as a quick meal.  We had an excellent weekend enjoying their food, ales and conviviality, and I should be very happy to return." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/1904/" title="A Victorian village pub currently owned by Greene King.  There is a small garden with a children’s play area and some parking spaces at the front.  The single bar is ordinary and devoid of atmosphere, feeling more like a waiting room than a place to enjoy conviviality.  The barman was supercilious and unhelpful, needed help in identifying what a full pint looked like, while the few locals that were in just looked miserable.   Food was overpriced and dull.  There was one ale on, Old Speckled Hen, which was also overpriced and fairly uninspiring.  One craft beer, East Coast IPA, was predictably too cold, tasteless and very luch overpriced.  Fine at a push, but I wouldn’t race back here, and the fact that at 10PM on a Saturday, the day after our visit, it was empty, while The Fox was packed, suggests the locals agree." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
