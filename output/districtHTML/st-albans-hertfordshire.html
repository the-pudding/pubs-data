There is a lower level seating area with leather bench seating,a flatscreen dominates one side of the L shaped interior,while the rear door leads to a vast beer garden,a major draw in good weather.
Overall it felt like a chain pub and the bar staff seemed unenthusiastic .There are 7 handpumps,but on my trip two were \"available soon\" leaving Doom Bar,Mighty Oak Here Come Summer,Windsor & Eton Guardsman and Oakham Inferno and Northern Pacific (not at the top of it\'s game).
There are also 6 wall mounted keg taps set in white tiling but serving some megabrewery owned former craft beer brews.
Worth a quick one on a real ale crawl,but lacking any charm to stay a while." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
