[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/64615/" title="Another old pub dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century, but it does at least still feel like a pub. The wood floor is stained and polished for a change, but the walls are still in dull colours or bare brick. Despite the large number of windows and random light fittings it still feels quite dark inside, probably due to excessive brown paint on much of the ceiling. Decorations include a lot of old beer memorabilia, some quite interesting. Draught ales at time of visit were Doom Bar, London Pride and St Austell Proper Cracker as the Christmas guest, which was quite drinkable (Cask Marque accredited). There are also sundry craft beers on keg." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
