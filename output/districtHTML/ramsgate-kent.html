[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/79828/" title="Decent enough Micro pub but I have to say I didn’t warm to it as much as others have on here. 
There are several positives. It’s a comfortable one roomed space with decent wooden seating and a clean modern decor that I thought was more cafe than pub. Very good service levels from the barmaid providing table service delivering the beers from the cold room in the corridor. Good selection of well kept ales and ciders and wines for the non beer or apple juice drinkers. The chalk board named six beers, four available and two coming soon. The four available were Kent Brewery Prohibition, Mad Dog Brewery Little NEIPA, Walton’s English Pride and East London Brewery Pearly Queen. Tried the local Prohibition and then had to go for the Pearly Queen despite it coming from four miles from my home address because when served well it really is an excellent smokey Porter , thankful as it was here.
I think the slight downside for me was that I just didn’t find it that pubby. This may have been partially down to the fact that I visited on a fine summers day in Ramsgate and despite the spacious front windows it was still gloomy inside compared to the outside. Perhaps it will be very different on a cold Dark December evening." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/79817/" title="I will concur this really is an impressive Wetherspoons, which all came as a bit of a surprise to us. After parking the car in the East Cliffs car park on a glorious late August afternoon we were walking across the expanse of sand that is Ramsgate beach aiming for the town centre when we came across this fine example of Edwardian seaside architecture glinting in the sun. But more importantly it was being extremely well utilised with the upstairs balcony facing the beach overflowing with people enjoying themselves.
Enticed inside the sheer size of this one is difficult to take in until you fully explore the place top and bottom and even more difficult to describe in print and do it justice, but if I say we were lucky enough to grab an outside balcony seat upstairs which had just been vacated and our table number was 437, you will get some idea.
Things I liked about this one were:-
A) The building itself. This really is a fine piece of seaside Edwardian architecture originally built to celebrate the reign of Queen Victoria and full marks to Wetherspoons in prolonging it’s life as a building to be enjoyed by the public. And the almost 360 degree outside upstairs balcony affording great views of the beach to the back, the town to the front and the Marina to the side is truly impressive.
B) As a non-smoker I liked the way there was designated smoking areas at the two extremes of the outside balcony thus leaving a sizeable middle portion smoke free.
C) The hoards of black shirt clad Staff that swarmed about the various areas of the pub serving and clearing the multitude of tables so that the usual ‘spoons scourge of dirty tables and piles of empty glasses and plates was not seen here.
I agree with some comments below that it would have been nice if the available beers had included some locales, but there are plenty of Kent brewery beers available in the other towns pubs and what was on offer was far from shabby. These included Hanson’s Firefly, Ringwood Old Thumper, Coachhouse Brewery Coachman’s Autumn Ale, Celt Citra and Veterans Brewing Tracer Amber ale and the couple we tried were in good nick. A fine spot to while away an hour or so waiting for the towns Micro’s to open." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
