[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/33316/" title="Formerly The Portman Arms, this pub is best described as ‘eccentric’.  The name was given to distance the pub from the bad reputation of the previous business, and it refers to the eponymous children’s TV family rather than Guards or policemen.  It is open from about 7.30 in the morning until late at night; the derelict, closed facade is just that.  The car park is full of what looks like scrap Landrovers, and the building’s exterior is shabby.  There is no garden worth speaking of.  The interior is large, consisting of a restaurant which is relatively normal and will serve you just about whatever you want, and a bar which is undergoing substantial renovation even while it’s open.  The servery has been moved from one end to the other, and the original tiles on the floor show holes where stud walling has been removed.  There is a Harley Davidson fixed to the wall at one end, and there are shelves full of vinyl records, presumably waiting for the piles of hi fi equipment to be sorted and plugged in so they can be played.  The tables and chairs are piled haphazardly around the room, though there are some usable bar stools. There are, apparently, nine bedrooms for B&B but we didn’t see these.   The landlord was very sociable, making it clear we were welcome any time and explaining his plans to reclaim the inn’s former glory.  Only one ale on, Black Tor Blonde, which was in fair condition.  The pub is mainly used by locals, probably because it just doesn’t look open.  A work in progress, but worth a look in if passing" class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
