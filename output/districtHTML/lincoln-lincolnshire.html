All very nicely decorated with several seating areas with different seating options including high stools, comfy sofas and standard dining tables and chairs. All 5 handpumps in use on our visit, including a real cider. I went for the Northern Monk Striding Edge which is effectively hoppy chicken soup and whilst it\'s only 2.8% it has loads of flavour. I\'ve tried this beer in several of Manchester\'s beer institutions including Beermoth and this was as well kept as any. Called in the following day as well as Ms CAMRA really liked it here." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

      <p>Great place to crash out in. Bar to the left rear. No HP but a decent IPA @ 5% ABV. Possible return on the cards.</p>
