[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/85187/" title="A swift walk from Hackney Wick Overground, this is located either through the narrow White Post Lane, or, as per below, via the canal path that separates this from Fish Island. A reclamation of an old industrial unit, this is rather sparse inside decor-wise, although some interior curios include Haynes manuals stacked up above the bar and another manual appropriated as a shelf. We encountered this before a West Ham match (the stadium is a mere 5 minute walk away) and the space was divided into two rooms - a bar area to the left and larger, open space to the right, which, on this occasion, had a large pull-down screen showing an early PL game. A narrow decking out front offers a view of the canal and new Fish Island apartments which have sprung up - match days also include the infamous Rib Man whose \"Holy F**k\" hot sauce isn\'t to be taken lightly. Beers appear to be all keg - a couple from Truman\'s as you\'d expect included Pale Ale and a very good Roller IPA, which, despite being a fizzer, hit the spot." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
