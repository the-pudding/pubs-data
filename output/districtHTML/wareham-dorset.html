[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/60612/" title="Hidden away in the village of Church Knowle – the sort of place you’re highly unlikely to ever stumble across – the New Inn is an attractive Purbeck stone-built pub that is famous for its extensive seafood menu. The pub has a multiple room layout, parts of which date back to the 16th Century, when the building was a farmhouse. The main bar is located in a room known as The Tudor barn and has the servery along the rear wall of a room built entirely from the local stone. Some rather uncomfortable pews and chairs in various states of disrepair filled most of this spacious room and there is plenty of décor on show including high shelves and various large display cabinets all stocked with dusty books, old bottles and all manner of vintage items, which makes for a rather nostalgic and interesting bit of browsing. Plenty of old paintings and advertising boards cover the walls as well, giving the place a bit of a museum-like quality. There is a restaurant area off this room, which is the oldest part of the pub and contains two impressive inglenook fireplaces – one at each end of the room with a good number of tables and chairs in between. Various bits of brassware have been collected in here along with more of the same vintage ornaments, plus some photos of the local area. There is another room which seems to be set aside for larger groups, which has been decorated with lots of pictures and items relating to nearby Corfe Castle. This space has a nice vaulted ceiling in contrast to the timber beams seen in the other rooms. There’s a reasonable, compact garden area with a few picnic benches and a covered area, which has good views across the rolling countryside but unfortunately not of the castle.
We came here for lunch and found the food to be a bit on the pricey side but the portions were plentiful and my meal was very tasty. The full seafood menu isn’t always available – local catches determine what ends up on the daily menu – so don’t get too excited when viewing their online menu. Just two beers on the three handpulls – Sharps Doom Bar and Ringwood Best – which is a very uninspired line-up, but the Best was at least in decent nick.
This is a very attractive pub with lots of interesting features and items on display, good food and fine views. It let itself down a little with the beer range, service and pricing, but on the whole, I enjoyed myself here and would certainly recommend checking it out, even if it’s just for a quick half." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/10123/" title="Located at the top of a steep hill in the tiny Dorset village of Kingston, this is a fabulous multiple room pub with a great historic interior and one of the best beer gardens in the county. Entering through the front door, you find yourself in a stone floored corridor which leads through to an old service hatch – possibly a former bottle and jug. The corridor has been decorated with a photo montage showing the 1977 filming of the Mayor of Casterbridge starring Alan Bates, part of which took place at the pub. To the right, there is the upper bar which has a servery along the rear wall and a good amount of traditional seating through the rest of this rather bright space. The bar has a nice, rough-cut Purbeck stone counter and a more basic bar back and the room is decorated with lots of traditional pictures, photos and typical rural pub items. To the left of the corridor, there are two dining rooms, with hard bench and chair seating throughout. The first room has an amazing inglenook fireplace on the left hand wall with a lovely curved beam above. It was lit on our visit, making for a nice, cosy spot from which to enjoy our lunch. Black and white photos of various Dorset villages through time line the walls, which are mostly exposed local stone, giving the space a lot of character. Passing the left hand side of the serving hatch, some steps take you down, past a small landing area with a single table and sofa on it, to the rather fine, lower back bar. Here, the servery is along the front wall, facing an angular shaped seating area beyond, full of mostly standard tables and chairs and with another great inglenook fireplace on the end wall. Large windows look out to the beer garden and Corfe castle which can be clearly seen in the distance. A corridor to the left of this part of the pub has been decorated with various old maps of Dorset and leads you out to the the toilets and beer garden. The garden is a split-level space with lots of picnic benches and tables, including one made from an old millstone, plus some quarry stone seats. There is a kitchen serving hatch known as the Jerk shack, which opens in the summer and serves Caribbean cuisine and other BBQ goodies in the warmer months. The views of the castle from this garden are pretty much peerless and I would imagine the place gets pretty much packed out as soon as the sun puts in an appearance. One quirky feature of the garden is the gravestone of Michael Henchard – a BBC prop for the fictional character from Hardy’s The Mayor of Casterbridge, which was left behind after filming. The pub is child and dog friendly and can get very busy with family groups descending en masse at the weekends.
The pub usually stocks local ales and on our visit they had four brews from the DBC brewery on handpull – Durdle Door, Dorset Knob, Origin and Jurassic Bitter. The Origin was in good shape and served to us by a cheery but slightly scatty barmaid. We came here for some food and found the Sunday roasts to be very good quality with good portion sizes and efficient service.
This is a fantastic pub that really captures the feel of a traditional Dorset village pub well. There are many rooms to explore, each with their own interesting features, making return visits a must, and the beer garden and its views are worth the trek out here alone. This is one of my favourite pubs in the county and I eagerly await my next visit." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
