Opposite the Albion Brewery Bar, this has a small \"against the wall\" bar to the right on entry with a few keg taps and the decor is a mix of exposed brick, rendered wall and bare boards. A couple of local microbrewery offerings in bottles from Maule Brewing (Lucky IPA and Smashing Pale) in the fridge, but nothing more to trouble us beards. A stairway in the middle of the room leads up to a function area with its own bar and live music stage and has some great framed posters of luminaries such as Joy Division, NWA, Debbie Harry and 2pac amongst others. There\'s also a small, enclosed \"garden\" which catches the rays on a clement day." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
