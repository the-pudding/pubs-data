[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/54897/" title="Some good signs of south London boozer survive in this large pub, which has strayed a bit down the gastro route (scrubbed tables and menus on clipboards). An imposing bar back overlooks proceedings while the large windows and high ceilings give an airy feel. A pool table stands to one side, while at the back is a garden and an upstairs theatre space used for various entertainments. Round the back of the bar is an interesting sung, although it is spoiled a bit by a kitchen servery.
