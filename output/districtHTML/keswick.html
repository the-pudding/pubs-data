[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87509/" title="This is a very smart and upmarket hotel which also runs activities for parties of children. The bar is to the right of the reception desk, with two hand pumps serving two local real ales: Coniston Bluebird and Loweswater Gold. My pint of the Coniston (at £3.70 quite reasonable for the area) was not in the best of condition: my guess would be that it had been sitting in the pipe for rather a long time. I took it outside to sit at one of the patio tables in the ridiculously warm February sunshine. There\'s a great view of the fell from which the hotel takes its name, and which I had climbed two days before. This is a handy refreshment stop, although it\'s not really a pub - the Langstrath Inn and the Riverside Bar at the Scafell Hotel are clearly better - but if this is as far as your tired limbs are prepared to take you, it will do." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/61067/" title="The tiny, out of the way village of Stonethwaite is beautifully situated on a quiet road that meanders gently through the farm buildings and cottages until arriving at this hotel, almost the last building before countryside proper begins. This was my first visit here since 2007 - not because I never come to Borrowdale, but all my visits to the area in recent years have been in December or January, when the pub is closed. There is a hanging sign at the junction of the valley road, which proclaims that Monday is a closed day in February (and probably March too). So I had to wait until the Tuesday before I could pop in for a pint after my walk to the head of the valley and back. 

I entered through a door in the lean-to building that also contains the toilets and a couple of small tables and stools - there\'s also an entrance to the bar through the main door of the hotel. There\'s an open fire which was kept well supplied with logs while I was here. The bar counter is built of stone, with brass rails for elbows and feet, and four hand pumps serving Wainwright and two local beers at the time of my visit. The local Keswick Dark Horse 6% was a very nice beer, so I had a second pint, even though it set me back £4.50 (Wainwright was £4.10) and pretty much put paid to the rest of my afternoon. 

The person who served me and a couple of other walkers was friendly and chatty. She said that her brother\'s daughter wouldn\'t allow her to walk to the top of the valley any more. It was only when I asked what business it was of hers that it became apparent that it was her knees rather than her niece that were preventing her walking that far.

Apparently it can become quite busy in summer, with meals served in the patio garden across the road when the weather is favourable. It\'s quite safe, being one of the quietest roads in the whole of the UK, I would guess, leading as it does to some fields, a cottage and a small campsite. The interior of the pub is relatively small, with seating for maybe 20 at a pinch. I returned the next afternoon after my walk for another go at the Dark Horse, and fell into conversation with some more walkers - it\'s that sort of place." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
