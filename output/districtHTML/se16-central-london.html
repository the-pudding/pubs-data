[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/83228/" title="After the Partizan Brewery left these arches in favour of a larger set-up on the other side of the tracks, the Spartan Brewery took advantage of the existing infrastructure and installed their own equipment here, adding a new name to the Bermondsey beer mile in a familiar old location. The brewery takes up pretty much all of the ground floor space, with a small servery to the right and a beer board behind it being the only real concession to the general public at this level. It’s your typical concrete floored, vaulted ceiling, corrugated-iron walled beer mile archway, with the large beer vessels lined up to the left and rear with just enough room for one rickety looking table inside and nothing outside, although most punters were content to just stand around on the access road, drinking their pints outside. An iron staircase leads up to a small mezzanine level with low stools servicing two tables in an untidy space that seems to also be used as a storage area for various bits of brewery paraphernalia. A TV to the rear was set up to show the day’s big rugby fixture, but the light coming through the front of the arch made it almost impossible to see the screen. The projector was set up on two boxes of kettle crisps, which themselves were stacked on a box of pint glasses balanced on a small blue safe, all stood right in the centre of the room! Weirdly, a life-size cut-out of James Dean was stood at the far end of the room and it kept spooking me out as I was up there alone and kept thinking someone had snuck up behind me!
Unusually for the beer mile, this place has two cask ales, which on this occasion were their own Hoplite Session pale and Phalanx Dark Mild, alongside four keg options. The casks, rather alarmingly, were racked on a pallet on the floor next to the servery, so punters had to be careful not to accidentally kick them as they stood at the bar. The Session pale was £5.00 for a pint and in reasonable enough shape.
It\'s a shame that the Spartan Brewery seem to have applied their brewery name to their brewery taproom décor, as this is one of the most basic, unkempt, ramshackle places I think I’ve ever had a drink in. It was good to find some cask ale on the beer mile and the barmaid was quite friendly, but overall I didn’t really warm to this place and it was no surprise to me that it was considerably quieter than the other beer mile arches I visited.

Original review of Partizan Brewing on 8th October 2015: Rated 5

This is a microbrewery operation located in three adjacent railway arches and forming part of the ‘Bermondsey Beer Mile’. The first two arches are full of packaging materials and bits of brew kit, but the final arch has the main brew plant with a jerry built servery at the rear. The place isn’t really set up that well for those wanting to sample the brewery’s products on site. There is no seating within the arch, but a few benches have been arranged in the car parking bays opposite, which was fine on a sunny August afternoon, but probably won’t cut the mustard in the middle of winter. The arch itself is a drab concrete floored space, brightened up somewhat by some of the distinctive Alec Doherty artwork that Partizan use on their bottles. A young lady had set up a stall in front of the middle arch, selling a few wraps and other simple snacks, but it wasn’t clear whether this was a regular feature. Indie music played throughout the visit and it was quite fun watching the brewers performing all sorts of scientific-looking processes with various beer samples.
The brewery serves keg and bottled beer only, with the keg options on this visit comprising Pale Mosaic Cascade (£3.00 for a half), Pale WACC, Saison, Saison Raspberry and Lemon, Tripel and Atomium. I, along with everyone else in the queue, wanted to try the Pale Mosaic Cascade, as this was the first of eight breweries to be visited as part of the Beer Mile and it was the only beer with a sensible abv. However, some sort of technical glitch meant that this beer was pouring as approximately 90% foam, so I ended up having to have it in bottled format instead, which was a bit disappointing although the beer itself was actually pretty decent.
I found this was a bit of an inauspicious start to my crawl (I was supposed to start at Fourpure, but they were running late, so I ended up starting here and then retracing my steps). The place is not set up for large volumes of customers and I was glad it was relatively quiet when I arrived, as they were already struggling. Works as part of the crawl, but not somewhere you’re likely to linger." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

I went for something called Passion Pale Ale which was OK but hardly stunning, but at least it cost me significantly less than it would have done if I had paid for it in Sweden. The dark interior is enhanced by some funky lighting and my visit was enhanced (I think that’s the right word) by trying to find the toilets.
There are those that will rave about bars like this and there were several bright young things in at the time. But sandwiched between tap rooms for two of Britain’s cutting edge craft brewers I found its presence on the Bermondsey beer mile to be a bit of an irrelevance." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
