      <p>Grade II Listed building - impressive high ceilings and loads of space.   Like an independent Wetherspoons!

Architecture is where the similarity ends.   This is a proper beer lovers pub - with a wide range of beers on offer - all detailed on slates over the long bar.  I went for a breakfast stout - which was perfect.

Lots to admire!" class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
