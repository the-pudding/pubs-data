[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/15842/" title="This is another Crayford pub that hasn\'t changed much since Roger\'s visit some seven or so years ago. To the left and right of the room are brick built fireplaces that match the brick built bar counter, and actually give it something of a modern look. There are separate, but connected, rooms at the back, and in one of them Paul Scholes\' football shirt has been replaced by a Brazilian national team one apparently signed by some bloke called Pele. Jimmy Bullard\'s signed England shirt is still quite rightly prominently displayed in the front room though. 

Furnishings were fairly traditional, and my group, completely appropriately, sat in a corner in front of a sign that read \"Old Gits Corner\". There wasn\'t anything special in the way of ale with just London glory and Courage Best available but nonetheless we thought it a decent enough and fairly traditional pub." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

      <p>This locals&#039; pub had on a couple of real ales - Courage Best and Bombardier. I can&#039;t remember which one I had, but I don&#039;t recall it being particularly good or bad. I didn&#039;t see any sign of food on Wednesday afternoon.

I can\'t remember which one I had, but I don\'t recall it being particularly good or bad. I didn\'t see any sign of food on Wednesday afternoon.

This pub hasn\'t changed much, if at all, since Roger\'s visit around 10 years ago. It\'s still got its mock Tudor exterior, which was much in vogue for inter-war pubs; it\'s still carpeted; the ale choice hasn\'t improved much; the ceiling battens are still there; it\'s still carpeted and still has both a pool table and a dartboard. The old Courage cockerel is still on the exterior, and of course they still sell Courage Best. All very traditional. There are three original brick built fireplaces, no doubt one for each of three separate rooms this pub would probably once have had.

There must be a Chelsea connction with the landlord I guess, judging by the Chelsea stuff around the place. One of the chimney breasts had an old Chelsea photo on it, from which I recognised Charlie Cooke and David Webb. They had a good number of apparent locals in when we visited - in fact a fair number more than any of the other Crayford pubs. Personally, I like these traditional old pubs, and this one would score higher if it had an interesting ale or two on." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
