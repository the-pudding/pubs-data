[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/31219/" title="The Bromley in Fiskerton is a large riverside Greene King pub on the banks of the  river Trent.  A 2014 refurbishment has meant that what was once an old school Hardy and Hansons pub is now a large Greene king run of the mill chain pub with tier usual no descript chain decor and lack of original features. . As you enter there is the option of the wooden floored bar room to the right with high tables or the carpeted lounge with sofas and normal height seating. The biggest selling point is the fantastic riverside beer garden with many seats overlooking the Trent. 

The beer choice as you would imagine is very limited over the three pumps wiht just GK IPA, Abbot and the local harvest pale available with one not in use but looked like Old Speckled Hen. Fiskerton is in an affluent area and the prices reflect this with a pint of the pale coming gin at a very wallet unfriendly £3.85 a pint!! Its not often you pay that in a norther Greene king pub, especially in Nottingham. 

Overall this was a pretty run of the mill pub in a really nice affluent village (they deserve something better really) however the harvest pale was in top notch shape so extra credit there. The Full Moon a ten minute walk away is infinitely better but on a sunny day the beer garden here really is hard to beat so I suppose it serves its purpose, I would return if ever on a walk around the lovely surrounding villages  but its not one for staying in." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/31224/" title="The Final Whistle, formerly the Newcastle Arms is a project WIllaim pub a five miniute walk out of Southwell’s Main shopping street. It sits on the former site of Southwell’s railway line and the outside fences have been made to look like a station Platform. I say it is a project William pub bit unlike their other pubs this one has now recently had is pub sign branded as Everards so whether the brewery under the Project William scheme for this pub have pulled out I am not sure. Either way aside from the two Everards beers there were many guest beers including offerings from Leatherbitches, Salopian, Oakham and bass as well as others over the 8 hand pulls. We had the Oakham Inferno on the slightly steeper side for £3.60 but this was superbly kept and was the pint of the day. There is a lovely outside grassy seating area with lots of tables and another outside area in the centre of the pub that on my visit was used for a wedding reception. The pub is largely wooden floored traditional boozer style with many rooms but not for diners as they don’t do food which I like to see in a proper pub. Along with the crown in Beeston the best project William pubs and probably the best pub in Southwell and well worth a visit." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
