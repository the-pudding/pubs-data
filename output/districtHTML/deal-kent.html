[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/84210/" title="I wasn’t going to bother with this one as it is quite a hike out of Deal. But after receiving a couple of recommendations for it from people in Deal we decided to visit the nearby Walmer Castle and take this one in at the same time and very glad we did.
Formerly the sub post office as mentioned below this one room micro is stuffed full of interesting clutter, a lot of it nautically themed, including some interesting pieces reclaimed from old sailing ships who came to grief just off the Deal coastline.
Four real ales available from the interesting four-handled Victorian beer engine and for our visit these were Musket Brewery Muzzleloader, Cattleshed Brewing Neipa, Old Dairy Uber Brew and Manxman 3Piers. And alongside a couple of ciders there is also a decent range of Spirits and wines and god forbid a chrome lager tap. Very friendly service levels and we were offered tasters of all four ales before deciding on the two to go for and both we did have were in prime condition.
Another nice touch is that although it does not do food, you are more than welcome to bring in a Pizza or Fish and Chips from the takeaways in the same parade." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/84462/" title="Bright bar at the top end of Deal High Street close to the Old town part. Modern decor with lots of exposed brick, wooden flooring and chunky wooden tables and chairs either side of a large brick fire place. Then a staircase leads down to additional seating areas which were more cosy but without the benefit of natural light.
I visited this one because the WhatPub description promised a good range of real and KeyKeg ales being available. Well not for my visit. The three shiny chrome pumps on the bar had Kent Brewery Prohibition, a cider and the third not in use. And having already had a couple of tired ales in previous Deal pubs I was wary of trying the one functioning hand pump. Fortunately there is also a range of keg taps which had Beavertown Gamma Ray, Three from Tiny Rebel and a couple from brewers I wasn’t so familiar with. I went for the Stout from Iron Pier which turned out to be a very good choice. 
There was only a couple of us in on this early Tuesday evening not long after opening time so not a great deal of atmosphere. But put a crowd in here and I could imagine it being a half decent bar." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
