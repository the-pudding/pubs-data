[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/81925/" title="A small one room bar, which was bordering on a micropub status. This was until I noticed a large flat screen TV behind the bar playing a music channel, plus a wall mounted jukebox on the opposite wall. There were a couple of beer drinkers on our visit, with the majority preferring the lager and keg offerings. So this one room bar had a choice of two cask ales, Helmesley Brewery Striding The Riding and Camerons Strongarm. We went for the Helmesley, which was ok. The main features in here was the wall on the left of the entrance, displaying a collection of various empty beer bottles and an old upright piano opposite the doorway to the small patio area." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/55943/" title="Quite pricey in here compared to the rest of town, averaging around £4 a pint. Still it had the best choice of beers across six handpumps. I went for the Bristol Beer Factory Notorious, which was fab, along with Rooster\'s Baby Faced Assassin. The interior had a small room on the right of the entrance, which was cut off from the main bar and lounge on the left. This was handy if you wanted a bit of piece and quiet. The main bar was facing you on the right, as you walked into the main room and the handpumps were positioned directly in front of you, which was good planning. The décor was cream walls with a collection of pleasing looking pictures and the woodwork was in a dark blue. Definitely one of the best bars in town." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
