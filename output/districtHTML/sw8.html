[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87714/" title="This is a relatively new brewery and taproom in the new Battersea Power station development. As is the case with so many of these places, it\'s in a railway arch. The brewery itself is in one arch, and the taproom in the adjoining one. The arch is larger than many other arches housing brewery taprooms, and in fact I\'ve been in many smaller pubs.  There\'s a horseshoe bar counter on the right; in front of it by the large plate glass windows is a large dull copper-topped table with normal chairs and some picnic bench style seating. To the left are a few tall table tables and tall stools crammed in that look pretty awful, having that \"made from scaffolding\" look. At the back are a few more tables and chairs, and at the front in the pedestrian lane is a fair bit of outside seating. The arch is tall enough inside that there\'s room for a smallish mezzanine level with a bit more seating.

Another first for me in a pub. I thought that the penny farthing bicycle in the outside seating area was a nice decorative touch, until some bloke got on it and rode away.

As is often the case now, this place has a greater emphasis on keg (\"craft\") beers rather than real ale. However, they do have a couple of handpumps, one of which was clipped for Battersea XPA (£4 a pint) when I arrived. Unfortunately it went off immediately, but was immediately replaced with another of their beers (forgotten its name), a brown 4.2% seesion ale also at £4 a pint. I tried a couple of their keg offerings - Battersea IPA (5.9% or so at £5.50 a pint, and their Scotch Ale at 6% and £5.60 a pint. The also sold \"paddles\" of beer at £9 a time, giving you four halves of beer - two of my companions went for one of these, allowing the barman to choose for them, and they got some of the more expensive beers included, such as the Scotch Ale. They did food, but not a large menu. The favourite seemed to be cheese toasties at £4 a go.

Although I\'m not a great fan of drinking in brick built tunnels containing ugly tall tables and tall stools, against all the odds I quite liked this place. The friendly and knowledgable (on his beer anyway!) barman made it seem a pleasant experience, and I enjoyed all the beers I tried, including the keg ones. As we all know, there is keg and there is keg, and some are a quantum leap better than others. This place only sells the better ones. I found that thinking ahead helps by buying your keg beer at least half an hour before you want to drink it to allow it to warm up a bit. I guess some afficionados of this style of beer might think me very strange for doing that - they\'re probably right!" class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/83395/" title="An uber modern bar operated by Youngs pubco but lacking river views due to the construction barges moored to the quay.You enter with the bar directly infront,to the left is a seating area with circular tables running the length of this section,with an open kitchen at the end.There are then two front wings,the first with a long bench and a series of square tables,the second further around is more pleasing with another bench seat and views of the external beer terrace.There is also an upstairs area with a maxi sofa,dining type tables and a drinking shelf with the loos at one end.
There are 3 handpumps offering on my trip Youngs bitter (doubled) and a decent St Austell Proper Job (£2.55 the half).
The flatscreens will air BT and Sky Sports events,muzak was playing at background levels on my afternoon visit,and the vast plate glass windows dominate the internal space,so it\'s a bar rather than pub.
The Proper Job saved my trip ,otherwise I could hardly see myself returning." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
