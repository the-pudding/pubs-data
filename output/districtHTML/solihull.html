[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/38605/" title="We called in here for Sunday Lunch, which was very good and the staff were very friendly and chatty. We had a beer in the front bar beforehand and the handpulled beer choice was Proper Job, Bank\'s Mild, Bath Gem, Wye Valley HPA and Hobsons Bitter. We went for the Proper Job, which was in great condition. From this small bar, area you take a left into the lounge area, which was long and narrow and this room led you into the rear dining area. The pub became increasingly busy around 12.30, as a wedding party arrived in from the church across the road, which was nice to see everyone dressed in their finery." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

Very much in the Marstons stable there were three beers from Thwaites on: Wainwright, Lancaster Bomber and Original with Froth Blowers Barking Mad as a guest. The latter in decent enough and slid down well." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
