[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/23766/" title="This is no longer the Greene King pub found by previous reviewers; GK have sold it to a finance company (and they have form in this respect), and now there\'s a (hotly opposed) planning application to demolish it and replace it with masses of residential accommodation. I wish the objectors well.

But for now it\'s a pub, and not a bad one at that. They had two real ales on - New River Riverbed Red (trips off the tongue that one), and Oakham Citra (£3.90 a pint), with another couple of handpumps unclipped. During my Wednesday lunchtime visit there was a blackboard advertising various burgers for £5 a pop. There were also clipboard menus on all the tables with all main meals at £8.50, including burgers - but these came with chips whereas my fiver version was sans chips. Good quality though.

This is a landmark pub, now painted brilliant white inside as well as out. The room at the front where I sat has a pool table and mainly standard furnishings. There\'s a large separate room at the back accessed via an archway to the left of the servery, which is where some sofas are located for those who like to lounge around in pubs as well as more normal tables and chairs. The bar counter also extends into a corner of this room. Behind this room is a sort of conservatory cum covered drinking area, and a garden with picnic bench seating. Unfortunately the garden is a little too near to one of the busiest roads in the country - the M1 - plus trains going past. There\'s tall fencing surrounding the garden which at least shields you from the sight, if not the sounds, of its noisy neighbours. You don\'t see many Morris Minors these days, but this pub had one parked out in front of it as well as another in a parking bay in the garden next to a classic MG as well.

The pub seemed to be staffed with delightful, energetic and crazy young girls during my visit. But they were very apologetic that their till wasn\'t working, and that for (hopefully) one day only it was card payment only. Well, I\'ve learnt my lesson on that score and against all the odds had a bit of plastic on me, which I just had to wave at the little phaser like device she was brandishing in order to get a pint of excellent Citra. It was very quiet when I was in, but I hope it gets busier in the evenings and at weekends. 

I found the white paint everywhere a little overly clinical, but nevertheless enjoyed my hour or so in this friendly pub." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

      <p>Despite the sign outside saying it opens at 11.00, it actually opens at 11.30. No big problem for me as I arrived just after 11.25 and found a door that was open that shouldn&#039;t have been. But the friendly barmaid served me anyway.

It&#039;s a Greene King... [<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/23762/" title="Despite the sign outside saying it opens at 11.00, it actually opens at 11.30. No big problem for me as I arrived just after 11.25 and found a door that was open that shouldn\'t have been. But the friendly barmaid served me anyway.

It\'s a Greene King pub, but unusually for this brewery\'s pubs it doesn\'t serve real ale. the usual array of lager fonts, plus of course they also sell Guinness as well as keg Abbott. So, a bottle of Brewdog Punk IPA from the fridge for me. It seems that a range of the bottled beers are on a two for a fiver deal. The usual Greene King illustrated pub grub menus are on all the tables, advertising the usual type of meal plus drink deals.

This is a massive rambling building of a pub. a very large island servery is surrounded by various interconnected drinking areas. There are numerous, mainly unused, doors so these would undoubtedly been separate rooms in the past. Furnishings are the usual GK mix of fixed bench seating, bucket armchairs, tall tables/tall stools and of course some standard tables and chairs. Red (soft furnishings) and crimson (walls and pillars) seems to be the predominate colour scheme.

Being such a large pub it inevitably lacks any intimacy and is really much of a drinking barn, but at least it\'s still a survivor in an area not exactly swarming with pubs. Frankly, it\'s not really worth a trek out to Hendon to visit, but OK if you live nearby and aren\'t fussed about the absence of real ale." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
