[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/86980/" title="The name says it all,this is a micropub for hipsters.A small shop conversion with an open area infront of a small bar,while up a winding staircase is a small long section with just enough space for a high table and bench seating,plus the loo.It\'s run by a young enthusiastic team and tasters are given of the 6 keg options,4 beers and 2 sparkling ciders.Cans and bottles make up the range,but you may not find too many CAMRA types in here,no real ale , a hip soundtrack and £5 pp.
The beer choice will rotate and is eclectic with on my trip Northern Monk Spiced Mocha Porter (great),Brick Blackcurrant and Sumac Sour,Tiny Rebel Christmas Milkshake and Steady Rolling Man Pale (excellent,not too cold nor overly gassy).
It\'s card only,understandable due to a large cash theft and the need to process clients quickly via touchscreen on busy pre match days.Along with the Goathouse this gives the discerning beer drinker something to go at in South Norwood.and it will feature some of the best keg options.I will be back." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

There are two ranks of four handpumps here,the ones visible as you enter the pub normally contain the interesting guest beers.The second bank of pumps is hidden off to the left and that is sensibly where the Abbott,Ruddles Bitter and ciders lurk.On match days this is the \"away friendly\" pub so your best option if visiting the mighty Palace.Despite the plastic mugs ,beer quality here is usually good these days.
ORIGINAL REVIEW Feb 2010 as The William Stanley
One of the smallest spoons with a limited ale range but two guests normally available which included on our visit Arkells Kingsdown which was well kept.There are seating areas either side of the front entrance and the decor is typical of the chain.On Palace matchdays drinks are served in plastic mugs but this is not the kind of pub where it will kick off.By 6pm the plastic policy was relaxed.One of the better of a poor selection of pubs in South Norwood.

UPDATE 
My first visit under the ownership of Antic and pleasantly surprised.PSM has done an accurate review of the changed interior,to the right there is now a red velour wall hugging banquette which gives lots of seating options.The ale range is now from 6 handpumps with two Voldens (Session and Pale) being regulars together with Belleville Battersea Brownstone,Dark Star Sunburst (decent £4) and Arbor Yakima IPA 7% on offer on my visit, with one clip reversed.An interesting range,although obviously more pricey than the \'spoons days while the keg offerings seemed quite mainstream.
I was in prematch so all drinks served in plastic mugs but of a more pleasing type than you often get.The pub is now firmly Palace fans only,unlike the William Stanley which was away fan friendly.It was busy as you might expect but if you just happened to be in South Norwood looking for a decent pint of real ale,this is probably your best option.No sign of food ,however,but that may have been another prematch issue." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
