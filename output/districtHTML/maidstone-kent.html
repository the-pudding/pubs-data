[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/88303/" title="The tap for Musket Brewery, located in the front part of a new building which also houses the new, larger brew plant that is currently being readied to produce its first batch.  Set up inside like a micro-pub inside, with a limited amount of seating and jacketed casks on a double stillage behind a basic counter.  With five real ales on offer - including the green-hopped Flash in the Pan (£3.00, and in excellent shape, as you would expect) - there was plenty of choice.  Well worth seeking out (but check opening hours first because these are restricted)." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
