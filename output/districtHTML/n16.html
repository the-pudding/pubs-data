[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/25634/" title="This pub doesn\'t seem to have changed much since Tris\' visit a year or so ago. Inside, if I\'m being generous, I might call it shabby chic. as you would expect of a totally madeover pub, it\'s got exposed brickwork, sofas, tall tables and tall stools, metal ducting along the ceiling - but most of the seating seems to be tubular metal-framed chairs that look a bit like Antic rejects. There\'s an open to view kitchen that was dishing out heaped plates of food in industrial quantities to a private party at the back (probably a wake by the amount of black being worn) when I was in at around 4.0 PM on a Wednesday.

There were however two ales on - Timothy Taylor Landlord and Enefeld London Pale Ale (£2.30 a half), with a couple more pumps unclipped. I also saw some beer specials advertised: Sol, Corona and San Miguel all £3 all day. Seems a bit overpriced, but what do I know about what those beers are worth? 

It\'s not really my sort of place, but it\'s still a pub of sorts and I guess the regulars like it that way. But I doubt whether I\'ll be back." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/25637/" title="I’ve been to some grotty Wetherspoons in my time, but this one, with a prime High Street location, has to rank right up there as one of the grimmest. You enter into a carpeted room  with some seating under the front windows and banquette booths down the left hand wall, broken midway along by a neglected old fireplace. The servery is over on the other side of the room, along the right hand wall, and has a typical dark wood counter and ‘Spoons bar back, plus an unusual white canopy. A small skylight above the bar area acts as a vaguely eye-catching feature and helps illuminate the high tables and stools that fill the central part of the room, opposite the bar. Two arches lead though to the pub’s mid-section, carpeted by both carpet and a layer of detritus (menus, waste food, beer bottles) that had accumulated over the course of the day (or perhaps week – who knows?). Tables and chairs run through the centre of this area, with floral wallpaper, contemporary paintings (including one of the eponymous castle) and ‘Spoons info boards on the walls. The nicest area in the pub by some way, the area also boasts a large skylight surrounded by elaborate moulded plasterwork and a series of small, nude statuettes. Moving on again, you reach the rear section of the pub, which looks like a modern addition thanks to conservatory style windows around three sides and plenty more seating within. A garden can be accessed from here, but it was too dark to get a proper look at it, which may just have been for the best. It took me some time to find a table that didn’t have a pile of uncleared plates, glasses, or other such crap on it and even then, I ended up amongst rowing couples, staggering all-day drinkers and one bloke slumped, possibly dead, across his table.
The bar offered some kind of salvation for the unsuspecting visitor, thanks to five guest ales that took their place alongside three ‘Spoons regulars and a real cider. After a bit of fuss and confusion with the hopeless barman, I managed to extract a pint of Enfield Pale Ale at the usual reasonable price, which was very much sub-par and arguably on the verge of turning undrinkable, although I managed to get through it.
What an absolute dump this place is – it must go down as one of the most uncared for ‘Spoons in the country, which seems to be reflected by the clientele it attracts. I’d had enough of this place after the first five minutes or so and things didn’t get much better after that. ‘Spoons get a bad reputation at times and places like this don’t do anything to help dispel that myth – it would take a pretty serious overhaul to get me back in this pub again." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
