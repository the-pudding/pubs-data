Five ales on handpump, mainly dark beers, on our visit, so we settled on the Burton Bridge Stairway to Heaven, which was worthy of a second pint.

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/52891/" title="Another well run, Project William schemed pub, that is traditional in style and décor and the main feature on my visit was the Art Deco designed bar front, found in the main bar. The two main, front steel crittall windows are also of the 1930s Art Deco period.. You can also enter this pub via two main front entrances, the one on the left leads you straight into the main bar. The right hand side entrance leads you into a lobby, from which you enter a tiled snug area and the back lounge. Five Titanic ales and three guest on handpump. Two of the guests were from Everards and the third was from Elgoods Golden Newt. We went for the Elgoods and Everards Tiger, both were very well kept." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
