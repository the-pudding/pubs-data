[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/63744/" title="Now owned by Punch after the demise of Mitchells, and has had a refurbishment giving it a bright and shiny interior. The bar has seven hand pumps, which surprised me as I can remember this place when it only served Mitchells Bitter. There\'s a beer garden on the canal, which I didn\'t explore on this occasion, preferring to study the old photos on the walls, and the coloured diagram of how the two railways companies served two stations in Morecambe back in the 19th century. Service was friendly, but the lass didn\'t know who brewed Royal Pale 4%, a rebadged house beer, which she said was their best seller and certainly it was pleasant enough without pulling up any trees. (The others were Sharps Doom Bar, Adnams Ghost Ship, Bradfield Farmers Blonde and Hawkshead Windermere Pale.)" class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
