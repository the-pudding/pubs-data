[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/69597/" title="Formerly The Connection it reopened on 9th October with new name Hullabaloo, selling street food and craft beer under the slogan \"Putting the hip in Shipley\" Split level crafty type bar with 5 pulls and half a dozen taps of better kegs on a horseshoe plus a Berliner Pilsner on its own font. There\'s a comfortable lounge area with armchairs at the back, an area with tables and chairs in the centre and a mix of stools and bench seating at the front. A mish mash of decor styles with photos, posters and painted cupboard doors, the interior is decidedly woody. The toilets are upstairs next to a disused theatre which is sadly now inaccessible for public use." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
