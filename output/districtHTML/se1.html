      <p>This is a Fuller&#039;s conversion, in the shadow of the Shard, that had on London Pride, Hophead, and Fuller&#039;s Botanist&#039;s Batch (&pound;2.60 a half).

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/54044/" title="This is a Fuller\'s conversion, in the shadow of the Shard, that had on London Pride, Hophead, and Fuller\'s Botanist\'s Batch (£2.60 a half). They clearly do food as there\'s a separate and slightly raised area on the left with all tables laid for diners. But the main bar area for drinkers is larger, and as this where I sat I didn\'t get to see a menu. But I wouldn\'t expect the food prices to be cheap if the beer prices are anything to go by. 

The pub itslef is all modern and characterless, but functional I guess. It\'s not very bright inside as the windows are relatively small and the awnings also cut down on the natural light getting in. I suppose I could also blame the promixity to the Shard. But I guess City types don\'t mind these sort of places. Furnishings are predictably a mixed bag - banquettes, a few normal tables and chairs and of course too many tall tables/tall stools. In the dining area the prints on the walls are all arty farty stuff, but elsewhere are telephone themed, with one wall having a dozen or so old (70s perhaps by the look of them) telphones mounted on it as decorative feature.

I reckon this is the sort of place you might drop into for a swift one - I can\'t imagine anyone wanting to spend any length of time in here, or it having any local regulars. And the beer prices are at the top end of the range, even by London standards." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
