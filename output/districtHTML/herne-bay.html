[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/64090/" title="The original micropub and I had intended it to be my first of the day, but when it unaccountably didn\'t open at 12 noon as advertised, I went on to seven others in Herne Bay and Margate before trying again here on my way back to my accommodation. It transpired that the owner had attended a funeral though he didn\'t bother to explain why a note to this effect was not affixed to the front door. He\'d obviously had a suitable amount to drink before evening opening at his own pub, and there were four or five other people in when I arrived, meaning the place was pretty close to full.

As with most of the micros I\'d visited, there are no hand pumps and in this case no bar counter or till, change being dug out of the owner\'s trouser pocket. The beers are kept on stillage in a cold room which doubles as the corridor leading to the toilet. My half of Old Dairy Uber was in very good condition, though not really to my taste. 

This is a seriously small pub and not one for those who prefer not to engage in conversation when drinking. Luckily I\'d had just enough beer spread over the course of the afternoon to make me happy enough to join in with the lively banter before getting back on my bike for my (as it turned out) safe and uneventful return to Canterbury.

There are six hand pumps on the bar, with three beers from the local Goody brewery plus one from rather more distant Lincoln Green. The owners appear to be a couple, one of whom was doing something on a laptop out in the customer area, and had to get up and go behind the bar to serve me. I didn\'t detect any interest in her customers, and I had to ask about the three Goody beers, which were unfamiliar to me, getting only a perfunctory description. This place seems like a regular bar to me, with a large range of spirits, it just happens to be small. The beer I went for was in poor condition though not so bad that I was prepared to interrupt the laptop again to ask for a replacement.
