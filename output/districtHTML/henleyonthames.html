[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/54858/" title="Quinno expertly sums up the decor of this three-roomed pub in the owned estate of Hambleden. The bar serves what was once two rooms, albeit knocked through: one a snug with two handpumps and the other narrower, with six handpumps but precious little room if barflies are congregated at the bar and the window seat opposite occupied. A further room with semi-bar counter is located up a small corridor at the right and back to the left, so behind the bar itself, as well as a standalone dining area to thr right off the end of the corridor. Rebellion IPA and Windsor & Eton Last Drop on the first two pumps, with just Brain\'s Rev James and a Rebellion yearly/monthly one-off called Afterburner on the six other pumps. Four pound-fifty seemed rather excessive for a pint of the W&E (although it was on good form) and a weeknight after work visit saw this a little \"locally\", albeit in more of a plummy-voiced way." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

A nice old building on the outside, with the inside having been done out in a very \'modern ambient\' feel. Two ales on (Brakspear Bitter and Marstons list guest) which are usually OK without being overly inspiring. Large rear conservatory is laid out for food - friends have eaten here and enjoyed it." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
