This is a bogstandard estate pub a stone\'s throw from the upmarket St John\'s Wood. Inside it\'s carpeted, with bucket armchairs and dark varnished tables. There\'s a dartboard, a pool table, a TV on showing some film that the barmaid told me was called \"Scrooge\", plus pithy sayings, mostly unintelligible, scrawled in chalk on most of the flat surfaces. I also saw \"Whiskey Mick\'s\" jam sessions advertised for Tuesdays. 

There\'s nothing of special interest here; it\'s just a straightforward locals\' pub. But sometimes these unremarkable pubs can be cherished by their regulars. I hope that\'s the case here and they get a reasonable footfall in the evenings." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/68452/" title="This is still an Irish pub, and and it\'s quite nice that they\'ve retained the original name without giving it an \"Irish\" name. Like most Irish pubs, this one is traditionally furnished with banquettes and normal tables and chairs. The carpet is a bit tatty in places, but does the job. There\'s some nice fielded panelling on the walls, but for me the most impressive feature is the green-banded glazed windows both at the front and the back where the windows border the small garden. Probably originally a Charrington pub then. There\'s a dartboard at the back. 

This is most definitely a wet-led drinkers\' pub. Although there were more than a dozen or so customers in there it was very quiet - some were on their own nursing a pint, with others engaged in quite conversation. The background music was playing so softly that one had to listen intently to identify the songs being played.

Of course there\'s no real ale - Guinness was £1.90 a half, and I saw no sign of food. This is just the sort of pub that I like; if only they did the sort of ale selection available at the Sir Colin Campbell down the road. But there\'s no call for it I suppose." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
