Quite a find. Smart pub in the village centre - big car park, large beer garden. Inside, a typical country pub - low ceilings, room on room through a series of extensions.

Two wye valleys (butty and HPA) and a Hobsons on. Took one sip if the HPA and thought, this is perfect condition. A check on the Good Beer Guide confirmed its status.

      <p>Canalside pub - Marstons, with Banks, Ringwood and Wainwright availble.  Multilpe rooms - with a tiled bar area and a wonderful wood burning stove in the corner.... the highlight of the visit was the baguettes - cheap and delicious.</p>
