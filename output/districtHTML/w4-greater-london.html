[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/78470/" title="Well, I never went in here when it was a Cafe Rouge, but I\'m pretty confident that the Steam Packet (a reversion to its original name) is a massive improvement. Like other Food & Fuel branded pubs, it\'s full of good quality furnishings and decor. There\'s a clutch of tall tables/tall stools near the door, but otherwise furnishings are pub standards fixed bench seating and normal tables and chairs. The bar counter - and everything else as far as I can see - is brand new with an attractive brass rail at the front of the counter top decorated with brass mermaids. You don\'t see that every day. The back wall of the front room, as well as a pillar, has modern aquamarine tiling, which doesn\'t look out of place here. A sole rug breaks up the bare-boarded floor, and the upmarket/gastro look is enhanced by having a single rose in a small vase on all the tables.

Through an arch at the back is another smaller room with more normal tables and chairs, and with wood panelled walls. There\'s some outside seating at the front of the pub, as well as on a first floor balcony.

There were two ales on - Sambrook\'s Junction and Twickenham Grandstand (£4.40 a pint) - with a third pump unclipped. A glance at a menu shows a distinct lack of pub grub.

This pub looks good from the outside with with its iron railings and pillars, and with its attractive setting almost on top of the river. It\'s a bit too \"gastro\" for me, but I still enjoyed my brief visit here with an excellent pint of Ggrandstand. I think it makes a fine addition to the Strand on the Green, and completes an excellent quartet with the other three pubs along the footpath." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
