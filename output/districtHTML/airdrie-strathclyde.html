[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/57098/" title="There were six handpumps on the counter, and a sign by the door advertised real ale. But alas the handpumps were a relic from the pub\'s Wetherspoons\' days, as the sign was a clear misrepresentation as they no longer sell real ale. Although they open at 9.0 AM, they don\'t serve alcohol until 11.00. My companion and I arrived a few minutes before 11.00 and as we were drinking pints of Guinness the barman was prepared to start pouring our pints so that they would be ready to purchase at just after 11.00.

Although it\'s no longer a \'spoons, it still has that \'spoons feel about it. Airdrie really is now a real ale desert now that the \'spoons has gone." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

There is reclaimed wood everywhere - comprising partitions, on walls and beams, and exposed brick wallpaper is on the walls as well. But on the plus side there are mainly standard tables and chairs with some fixed bench seating, and with just a couple of tall tables/tall stools. There\'s also a dartboard.

But like everywhere in Airdrie, it doesn\'t do real ale although it did have Bellhaven Best on tap. There was no food on Friday lunchtime, and although they don\'t sell hot drinks the landlady very kindly made the three ladies in our party cups of tea for which she didn\'t intend to charge anything. That\'s a level of generosity that I\'ve yet to encounter in London.

Like everywhere in airdrie it\'s a locals\' pub, as I don\'t expect they get a lot of tourists. As a pub it\'s OK, but a decent real ale would improve things immeasurably." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
