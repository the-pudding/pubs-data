[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/39590/" title="Rather oddly painted in two shades of green, but I didn\'t let that put me off. I had taken a wrong turning, due to recent road improvements having made my map out of date, and thought I could combine a swift half of Harveys Sussex Best with checking directions to Ditchling, Plumpton and Lewes. I was successful with both endeavours, though the bitter was nearly as old as my map and only more drinkable by a narrow margin. I didn\'t complain, because the only other pump clip in sight on the bar was for Old Rosie cider." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/39600/" title="A proper village local, this -  a real drinkers\' pub. There were four hand pumps with Gales Seafarer, Harveys Sussex Best and two from Greene King: London Glory and Hardy & Hansons Old Trip, but all the beers were being served straight from the stillage, through a door behind the bar. I had the Sussex Best, which is one of my favourite beers, and it was in excellent condition.

The pub is slightly awkwardly situated on a mini-roundabout at the north end of the village, on the old London Road. The bar is to the right as you enter, with stools and high chairs and bespoke drinking shelves. To the far right is a lovely old circular dining table. On the left is an area with sofas and further left still some smaller tables. Straight ahead is a drinking corridor of sorts, with a pool table in the room between the back door to the small garden and the toilets. 

The landlord was sitting with a few regulars while his son tended the bar, and the atmosphere was friendly and comfortable. One small quibble: there was some quiet music playing in the background, which I felt was not really in keeping with the ambiance of the pub. The conversation was flowing nicely, and even if it wasn\'t, what\'s wrong with a little silence? Other than that this was a really nice pub." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
