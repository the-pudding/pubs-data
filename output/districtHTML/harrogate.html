[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87722/" title="A nondescript grey modern building houses Roosters brewery and taproom. Entering through a lobby you can admire the many awards the brewery has won. Into the taproom proper the brick built counter is to your left, two large screens will tell you the draught beers available from eight pulls and eight taps mounted on the rear wall. Pricing is comparable with Harrogate pubs £3.30 - £3.90 depending on strength. A range of “small pack” beers (bottles & cans) is available for drink in or takeaway, Roosters are masters of canning beers by the way. Cider, wines, spirits, soft drinks, hot drinks and bar snacks are also available. There’s a sandwich shop  over the road if you fancy something more substantial. Internally much as you’d except but with a bit less grey and definitely less industrial clutter. Seating is at long tables with either benches or metal frame chairs, mostly hard but there are a few padded ones. It’s a fairly big space and there’s a beer garden on two levels at the back, train spotting may be possible from the upper level. Big windows down one side give views of the brewery, not functioning yet but due in summer 2019, meanwhile brewing continues at the old site in Knaresborough. Beer quality is as it should be for a brewery tap unlike some." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

It looks like there\'s just the one room, but there are more rooms upstairs A couple of high tables to the left as you enter and some fairly rickety tables and chairs elsewhere. There\'s lots of dining tables and chairs upstairs and quite a few were eating, but it wasn\'t that busy. We had to wait to get served as there were no staff around. Eventually a guy got up from one of the barstools and said \"If no-one else is coming I\'d better serve you then, although I finished an hour ago\". The ale choice was Windermere Pale or Roosters or Harrogate which I thought was a decent enough range. My pint was in good nick and Ms CAMRA liked her red wine. I\'m not convinced about this place. We may well call in again, but with a great choice of better places in Harrogate, we may well not bother." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
