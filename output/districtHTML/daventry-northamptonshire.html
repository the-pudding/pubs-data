[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/29928/" title="The Nelson is perfectly located for a relaxing pint on a sunny day. It sits next to a lock on the canal in Braunston with fields on either side and there is plenty of outside seating both beside the lock itself and along the canal. The building is traditional canalside but the interior, which has recently had some attention, is curiously lacking in charm despite some original features such as beams and fireplaces. It almost feels grubby, much of which is due to a light, soiled, tiled floor circa 1980\'s I\'d guess. Three real ales are on: Hook Norton Old Hooky, Spitfire and an excellent pint of Summer Lightening which makes a visit worthwhile alone. Food is offered but is standard pub fare which didn\'t look enticing and reports aren\'t favourable although we didn\'t eat. Definitely worth a visit on a fine day when you can enjoy a quality pint, pleasant scenery and a spot of gongoozling all at once.

UPDATE - September 2011

A flying visit found the Nelson under new management but with the only change being two new benches by the lockside and a new range of beer: Black Sheep, Tiger and Brains were offered. It is always possible to moor in the pound in between the 2nd and 3rd Braunston locks with the 3rd lock being where the pub sits so access is very easy if boating.

UPDATE July 2012

Well The Nelson has really got its act together. Outside is much tidier with many new tables overlooking the lock and the canal while inside has a new wooden floor, new carpets and new furniture in the sofa and easy chair style around the bar area and pine tables and chairs in the restaurant area to the left as you enter.
Service is now friendly and helpful and there\'s a new, shortened, menu which we indulged in and was excellent and well served. It\'s decent pub grub so don\'t come looking for gourmet but it is well done.
Ale has improved as well since my last visit with three handpumps offering the excellent Summer Lightening, Hooky and one other which escapes me.
No problems with mooring either above or below lock 3 which is next to the pub and that\'s exactly what I\'d advise as it allows more Summer Lightening quaffing time.

UPDATE September 2019

After some time for sale the Nelson is now well and truly an Everards house with Sunchaser, Old Original and Tiger across the pumps joined by Lincoln Green Archer as a guest. 
The Tiger was acceptable without being anywhere near as good as it can be and Lincoln Green seem to be a regular guest beer provider.
Little else has changed and the place seems well looked after with a spot to park your horse added.
The menu, never hugely adventurous, is standard pub grub with the deep fat fryer to the fore.
Still an excellent spot for a glass in the sunshine watching the boating world drift by." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/58426/" title="Recently reopened after what looks like a very expensive refurbishment into what city design studios think a country pub looks like.  There remain vestiges of a multi-room layout, beams, sloping floors. Of course painted too brightly, free standing furniture, main focus is restaurant style eating but there is space for drinking occupied by Sunday lunchtime bar blockers who shunned the high tables provided for their discomfort.  The best bit is the terrace outside with views over the lovely rolling countryside. 

Judging by the London registered Jags and Mercs and blokes dressed in Clarkson jeans and office shirts, the weekend clientele is people visiting their dachas here to patronise the local and patronise the locals.  The atmosphere may be a little less overbearing at other times.

The local Gundog Jack Spaniels (presented in a Purity branded glass, more attention to detail please) was the guest, served very cold: sadly its lack of condition broke through the iciness. Otherwise GKIPA and Tribute suggesting a pubco lease. 

It\'s OK for what it is, but don\'t expect a rural gem. It is, unusually for round here, open all day." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
