[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/55185/" title="Up on the main road outside Highgate tube station, this is a decent sized, opened-out gastro pub. You enter into a large open-plan main bar area with exposed floorboards and an L-shaped servery to the rear right. The left side of the room sees a sizable space set aside, presumably, for vertical drinkers, although at quieter times it makes the room feel empty and cold. A few tables and chairs and a tidy banquette in a bay window fail to make this an appealing place to settle down, with most customers opting for the far more preferable banquettes along the front wall, which run opposite the bar in a narrow space that generates a bit of atmosphere. The bar has a dark wood counter and modern shelving unit bar back, whilst the walls are painted mainly in dark shades with Marilyn Monroe artwork a recurring theme and some cool paintings positioned between each window along the front wall. To the right, a door leads through to a more formal feeling side room, where mixed seating including some comfy looking armchairs can be found. A lit fireplace helped create a warm, lounge feel to the room and some far-out artwork lent a quirky edge to an otherwise traditional setting, but I did spot a member of staff here monitoring table usage, so the room may be given over to diners at busier times. A terrible indie pop soundtrack droned away in the background but I didn’t spot any TV screens.
I was served by a very polite and formal barman who was a bit too rigid and robotic to manage a welcome of any warmth. There was a decent row of handpulls on the bar dispensing Wells Bombardier, Portobello Westway Pale Ale, Fullers London Pride, Robinsons Hop and Under and something called Dragon’s Fire from an unknown brewery. The Westway Pale Ale was £4.40 a pint and I have to say it was some way past its best, which was a real disappointment.
There are glimpses of a decent pub here, but the place falls short on a number of levels, making this quite a difficult one to warm to. I liked the side room and if drinkers can easily bag a table here then you might be happy to settle down here, but the main bar was bland and empty and the beer was subpar, possibly reflecting a wider ale range than the pub can support. There are lots of decent pubs in Highgate, so I’d only recommend this if you needed a quick pint before hopping on the tube." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/25481/" title="I came here for the first time nearly 30 years ago for Sunday lunch but didn\'t make a return visit until 2016. It\'s situated in lovely Highgate, one of London\'s highest locations, suitably positioned opposite Berthold Lubetkin\'s iconic 1930s\' modernist Highpoint.
The pub has a history going back to 1547 but the current brewers\' Tudor structure dates from 1922 and until recently, displayed a Charrington\'s hanging sign.
The first thing that hits you on entering is the fine log burning kitchen range which apparently came from the pub\'s previous incarnation - I love the smell of woodsmoke in the evening! There\'s a lot of dark wood panelling and conventional furniture dotted around an L-shaped room with rear L-shaped bar. The floor is modern bare boarded but is naturally worn. Also in abundance is much leaded lights with both internal and external stained glass, giving something of a heraldic nod to the slightly baronial feel. Furniture is generally traditional with some more modern items to the rear which is more of a dining area, beyond which is a garden.
We were in for the Swearing on the Horns, a twice-yearly ceremony which has been taking place since 1623, now raising money for children with cerebral palsy. Along with the Yard of Ale drinking, it was a jolly evening with a nineteenth century fancy dress theme sported by the friendly staff and some of the customers: the barmaid was dressed as a serving wench with the barmen wearing red and white striped blazers with straw boaters, giving the appearance of ice cream vendors.
Ales: Fuller\'s London Pride, St. Austell\'s Tribute, Charnwood\'s Salvation and Darkstar\'s Hophead on great form and at £4.60 a pint, not a bad price for the area.
This is a very nice pub and is a must-visit if in the N6 area. It also makes for a great crawl with the postcode\'s other hostelries.
The daily midnight - 1.00am Fri/Sat - late licence is a bonus but note that this is now a cashless venue; card payments only." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
