[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/61328/" title="An attractive exterior with a curved front window and some ceramic tiling in the door reveals,the interior is stripped out,with a series of high tables in both the front window recess and along the right wall,with the bar to the left.Further back is more traditional dining type tables while the beer garden has fake grass,a rank of seating pods and some seperate wicker tables and chairs.Food is very popular here ,and many tables has reserved times,but avoid these times and you can drink in peace until the diners turn up.The garden is equally popular with diners,although your four legged friend will be made welcome with a bowl of water.
There is a quiz and live music on Sundays  ,so there is a community feel at times.I popped in on a Sunday when the roast menu is the main draw,sharing platters for 2 or3 diners are offered and you can carve your own join with this deal.Most mains are around £15 and there are sliders,so a premium price but not surprising given the location.
There are 4 handpumps with on my trip Doom Bar,London Pride,St Austell Tribute and a decent Twickenham Naked Ladies. Your view of this pub may be dependent on when you visit,it was certainly busy on Sunday afternoon but maybe more fun on quiz night or after food service times." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
