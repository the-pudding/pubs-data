[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/16665/" title="Unchanged from the description below, the large dining room with its own entrance door and half of the bar was not in use on the late Friday afternoon we rocked up to this one. But the plain front bar and the bench tables to the front of the pub were in full use by locals enjoying an end of working week drink. And to concur with the review below it was noisy and boisterous and in fitting with its location, a lot of estuary English was being practiced. The front bar had a certain odour about it that I wasn’t sure was coming from the couple of dogs in situ or perhaps their owners, but it was enough to drive my good lady to the benches outside and to implore me to sink my pint with haste so that we could be on our way.
A shame really because the beer offering here was rather good. There are five handpumps in total, three in the public bar and two on the dining room side and the public bar pumps are double clipped to show what’s on in the dining room. For our visit Adnams Bitter, Canterbury Ales Merchants Stout, Old Dairy Uber Brew and Exmore Beast were on with one pump reverse clipped and the Exmore Beast was rather very good. But the whole experience was all a bit too basic for my good lady, so we did not linger long." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87231/" title="More a bistro than a pub, and not a very welcoming one at that.  It was previously a restaurant called Topes (another cliched Dickensian reference), and it’s run by the same team – perhaps in desperation, as Topes wasn’t a huge success.  The bar area is formed from two earlier rooms in the historic shop premises, decorated sensibly if a little bit on the trendy side.  There also appears to be an upstairs area, but we didn’t venture up.  No real ale is on so I ordered a pint of Curious Session beer, which apart from being expensive, took the stroppy little girl behind the bar several attempts to produce in the required quantity, accompanied by all the tired excuses about how the glass is lined (it wasn’t), how you have to pour an inch of froth, and so on.  The beer was too cold, and tasted like I imagine insect urine does.  It was also overpriced.  There is a large selection of gins, and some of the wine list looked quite good.  We then sat at an unreserved table and were told by another annoying princess that we couldn’t sit there as we weren’t eating. We chose not to eat as the food was expensive, haphazard, a mixture of road kill and trendy dishes in small bowls, though some other customers seemed to be enjoying their steaks.   I won’t be back in a hurry, mainly due to the staff attitude, high prices and lack of real ale. " class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
