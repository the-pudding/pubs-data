[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/64005/" title="Decided to give the place another try when in Buxton on Saturday evening.  Still has four hand pulls at the bar but this time offering Thornbridge Jaipur, Wincle Waller, Beartown LBS and Brewsmith Pale - a much improved selection compared to my previous visit.  The Beartown LBS was £3.50 a pint.

The place was reasonably busy on Saturday at around 8:30pm and some of the customers were dining but drinkers were just as welcome.  It had a nice relaxed atmosphere." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
