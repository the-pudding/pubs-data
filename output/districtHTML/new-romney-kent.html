[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/16518/" title="This place is essentially unchanged since previous reviewers\' visit. It provides somewhere for those staying in the adjacent Romney Sands \"holiday camp\" to slake their thirst after a day enjoying the delights of Greatstone. But, to be fair to Greatstone, the beach across the road from the pub is quite a nice one, and was quite popular on the desperately hot August evening on which I visited. There are some picnic style benches at the front of the pub, from where you have a sea view of course.

The inside of the pub is nothing to write home about. It\'s all very modern with cheap looking pine cladding all over the place, cheap looking tables and chairs with a few sofas in an area to the left that looked as if it was being utilised as a sort of impromptu creche. All the holidaymakers in there seemed to be watching the footy.

There\'s no real ale of course, and the handpump\'s now been removed, but the clientele in there didn\'t look like real ale drinkers. I had a pint of Staropramen (£4.70), and saw a basic pub grub menu available - the ham, egg & chips is £8.75. It looks a bit overpriced to me, but I suppose that that\'s seaside resorts for you. I\'m glad I made the effort to visit as I\'ve been past this place many times, but I expect it to be a one-off visit." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/16511/" title="I asked the barmaid here what bitters they had on and she said “all of them”. I couldn’t spot a handpump so I looked at the keg fonts and saw Doom Bar and Courage Best clips on a couple of them. A third one had Bombardier, but hidden behind some fluffy animal for some reason. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see that handpumps were concealed behind the three shiny fonts. I recall them being all the rage a few years ago, but didn’t realise any pubs still used them. I went for a half of the Bombardier (£1.80 a half), but it came up so undrinkable that it can’t have just gone off. The replacement (Doom Bar) wasn’t particularly good even by Doom Bar standards.  

This struck me as a restaurant with a bar as a sideshow. The largest area, on the right, was occupied by all tables laid for diners. I didn’t see as menu, and nobody was in there eating at around 7.45 on a Friday. The bar area had a public bar feel to it, despite the fact that it was furnished with sofas apart from a solitary normal table and four chairs, mainly because the handful of punters seemed happy to swear in front of the barmaid. The downmarket ambience was reinforced by the games and fruit machines, the large TV but which was muted so we could listen to the rap music being played. A sign pointed to a pool table downstairs, but I didn’t explore down there. 
I was glad I only ordered a half." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
