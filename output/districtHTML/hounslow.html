[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/62801/" title="Built into a corner of the Terminal 2 departures building, there are seating areas either side of the long white topped bar which has nothing in front of it, just a view facing the check-in desks. There is more seating in a mezzanine level above, which apparently has runway views but me and my suitcase weren’t prepared to venture up there to look. There\'s been half an effort with the décor in the form of some laminate wood effect panelling but basically it\'s little more than a pub of convenience. Six pumps with three ales and - oddly - three ciders. The ciders were skywards of a fiver bit the ales were between £3.50 - £4. Choices were GK Abbot, W&E Guardsman (which turned out to be unavailable, classic Spoonerism) plus a fair (as fair as the mass-produced sweet water can ever be) Doom Bar. Serves its purpose, I’d much rather be here than some of the over-priced outlets nearby." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
