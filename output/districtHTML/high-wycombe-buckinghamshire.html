A one room pub as described below it does have the advantage of a sizeable garden and equally sizeable car park out back and additional outside bench seating to the front of the pub, and the one L shaped room does have a decent open fire which I would imagine makes it a bit cosier in winter.
Two Rebellion beers on the bar with the Rebellion IPA looking like it is permanent and the Zebedee was on for our visit and this was a well kept pint.
There was no sign of locals ensconced on the bar stools for our visit but plenty of people eating inside and utilising the garden out the back.
If you are not local to the High Wycombe / Stokenchurch area then there’s not a lot here to make you go out of your way for. But if you find yourself in the area and want something to eat alongside a decently kept pint, then I can recommend it for that, especially as the meals we experienced were very good." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/2268/" title="A good sized and quite imposing old coaching inn in the heart of this pleasant village, a central archway leads you through the pub to the car park at the rear, with parts of the building off to either side with the main part of the pub seeming to be to the right.

Internally it’s quite traditional, with a low beamed ceiling, dark stripy carpet on the floor and a small brick fireplace to one side, although I’m not convinced that this was used despite the pile of logs in the hearth. Fitted benches were in the bay windows with regular tables and chairs elsewhere. The walls were a mixture of cream plasterwork with some others painted very dark, almost black. A large selection of artwork was on the walls, much of it apparently for sale. 

The menu offered a decent enough selection of dishes, although the prices were clearly a step or two up from your regular pub grub, with the Fish & Chips being £16, and the Ham, Egg & Chips £14.50, for example. I opted for the fish pie from the specials board, with a cheddar glaze and crispy onions. This was certainly a generous portion and tasty enough, although equally nothing outstanding.

Beers on tap were mostly from Rebellion with their Blond, IPA and Smuggler and these were joined by Tribute. The solitary cider was a rather disappointing Aspalls. Overall, not a bad pub, although with the accomodation and up market food, it does perhaps have the feel more of a hotel than a cosy old local." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
