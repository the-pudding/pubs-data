There was a good choice of ales on my visit, but a problem with the cellar cooling on a hot day limited my options. I sampled both Brewsters Hopehead and Oakham Inferno and both were just about holding up. There was also Royal Oak Bitter and a couple of Westons Ciders. Fortunately, the lager options included Pilsener Urquell, so a cool drink was available (with Pravha as another option).

The couple running the pub alerted me to the cellar problem and were friendly and conversational throughout my visit. Definitely a must-visit in this fine Cambridgeshire town." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

The welcome here was friendly and it\'s a nice place to be.
Beers on were Royal Oak Best Bitter, Newby Wyke Black Beards, Oakham Inferno and Musashi. Not a bad selection and the latter was very good, on decent form and well poured so held the attention for the evening.
The only pub I visited in St. Ives as we didn\'t feel the need to move." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
