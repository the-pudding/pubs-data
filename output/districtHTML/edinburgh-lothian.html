[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/48954/" title="Cannot add much to Blackthorn\'s detailed description only that this late Victorian pub was elaborately designed and established in 1896 at the height of the Temperance movement and has been operated by the Stewart family ever since.All the features are stunning but i was impressed by the revolving door,the ornate plastering and the upstairs gallery.
 There were 10 cask beers on the go all functioning and plumped for the Orkney Dark Island which was spot on. If you have never visited the pub and are close to Waverley station with time on your hands this is the place for you. You wont be disappointed." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
