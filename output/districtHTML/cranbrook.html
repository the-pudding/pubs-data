[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/15811/" title="This 17th-century white-weatherboarded country pub located on a quiet lane just beyond the small village of Iden Green (the one near Benenden, not to be confused with the hamlet of the same name a short distance away on the other side of Cranbrook) has thankfully reopened after a worryingly prolonged period of closure.  The interior has been given a modern makeover that certainly won\'t appeal to everybody (with some partition walls now just exposed timbers), but it was still a work in progress when I called in.  The windows behind the bar could also be used to serve the refreshed beer garden by the look of things.  Three real ales available from the four handpumps: the \'house\' Woodcock Ale from Rother Valley (£4.00), Harvey\'s and Long Man Long Blonde.  Apart from that, a fairly limited selection of other drinks and snacks at the moment, and no food until next month, but at least it\'s serving customers again." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/54916/" title="Picture postcard country pub with weatherboarded façade and peg-tile roof.  Thoroughly refurbished inside with a mixture of traditional and modern features that won\'t be to everybody\'s taste.  Partly opened out in the main bar and dining area, but with very low ceiling in places.  Very welcome open fire in the winter, with an additional woodburning stove in the smaller side bar which leads to the attractive beer garden that is a fine spot to sit in warmer weather.  As a Shepherd Neame house, Master Brew, Spitfire Gold (£4.30) and Bishops Finger were available from three of the four handpumps on this visit.  Well worth a detour if visiting nearby Sissinghurst, Goudhurst or Cranbrook." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
