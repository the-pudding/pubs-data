[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/55155/" title="Called in again yesterday, the hand pulls have now been reduced to three.  Two of these were clipped for Doom Bar (one with the old clip, one with the new style clip) and the other was \"Cut The Mid Drop The Bass\" by Nightjar.  Naturally this is the one I went for, at £1.85 for a half.  Unfortunately this was rather sour, and I am not sure it was meant to be.

There are four craft keg type taps but only offering fairly bog standard Brewdog stuff so nothing to get excited about there, plus another four taps for cider.

There was a sign boasting that the serve Tiny Rebel beers, but there was no evidence of that yesterday.  So perhaps a slight glimmer of hope there.

I\'ve never had that Nightjar beer before so not sure what it is meant to taste like so will have to keep an open mind, but it didn\'t seem quite right to me.  However dedicating two of your three hand pulls to Doom Bar is pretty unforgivable in my book." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/55156/" title="It had been a few years since I have been in the J P Joule, however I found nothing major appears to have changed when I visited yesterday lunch time.  Downstairs there is booth seating to the side wall, the rest of the seating is made up of standard table and chairs - high towards the front and low to the rear.  Upstairs provides more seating and a second (smaller) bar, with booths around the perimeter and the rest tables and chairs.

Downstairs there are 10 hand pulls split across two banks - the first bank consists of four hand pulls and boats the usual Spoons offerings of Ruddles, Abbot Ale (x2) and Doom Bar.  The bank of six has the guest ales, and all of these were on at the time of my visit and priced at £2.15 a pint (£1.08 for a half).  The upstairs bar has four hand pulls, offering the Spoons trio plus one of the guests duplicated from downstairs.  There was a \"craft\" menu by the bar listing the draught, bottle and can options available.

The usual mix of customers were in around 12:15pm.

I can\'t remember the full selection of guest ales but I had the Burnt Orange by Wadworth and Fortingale by Inveralmond Brewery, both of which were fine.  I seem to remember there was another orange/tangerine beer and a New Zealand Pale too.

There are a few tables out the front, which was sheltered." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
