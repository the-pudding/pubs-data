[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/86786/" title="This Grade II listed Station bar opens daily and was definitely worth getting off the train to have a pint here. This one room bar was finished to an extremely high standard, with buttoned back leather banquette seating, a well constructed bar area, polished in dark mahogany and the two original cast iron fireplaces, refurbished and as good as new. The walls were finished in a heritage green colour. They had also managed to keep the original oak floorboards. Three pumps with two in use on our Sunday Eve visit, Wylam Gold Tankard and Hadrian Border Tyneside Blonde. Both were in good order, so we waited for the later train. There was also a good sized seating area on the platform side." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

There are three main drinking areas, which consists of a main room, a snug down a couple of steps at the far end and a further room upstairs, which was a good size, for any over spill, when busy. There was a choice of five ales and four ciders/perry on our visit.
