The only slight complaint I had was that the available ale choice was a bit pedestrian with London Pride, Doombar, something called Prince of Wales Pale Ale (brewed in Burton so presumably a Marstons stable)  and St Austells Tribute but fortunately the latter was drinking very well.
No sweary blokes in for my recent visit, just polite conversation amongst the assembled punters enjoying a beer so happy to be able to give the pub itself the rating it deserves." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

I presume now decorated throughout with bit of a Gastro pub feel with the usual sterile clean interiors, wood flooring throughout the large internal space, half bright white walls and white ceilings and not a lot of wall decor to give the place a great deal of character.
But, in saying that, better this guise than  the previously boarded up pub, especially as the central bar area has six handpumps dispensing four guests along with the berweries own \'Beer Street\' and \'Nervous Energy\' brews. The seasonal Dark Star Hylder Blonde and the Beer Street were both good pints, so first impressions were that this is a very good start and one to be watched.
I didn\'t eat, but plenty were and the menu looked extensive allbeit a bit pricey for a normal pub fare.
And there is a decent sized secluded outdoor area as well..
Good stuff, another one saved." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
