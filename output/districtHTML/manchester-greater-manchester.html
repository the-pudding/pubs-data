[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/53660/" title="Found it open on this visit. It\'s up a bit of a hill and facing St. Stephens, hence the name. The main room is split into two by a partial wall and there\'s also a small pool room to the rear. It\'s all old beams almost throughout with loads of bric-a-brac attached to them. There\'s a large beer garden to the rear. Sadly there were schoolkids in uniform sat at the bar at 4:15 on a Friday afternoon. There was also a huge dog the size of a St. Bernard that was afraid of one of the little girls! It\'s a Lees pub with the Bitter and MPA available. The MPA was a decent pint and reasonable enough at £3. There\'s live music advertised on a Saturday once a month. A decent enough pub, but I\'m not impressed by the schoolkids being in." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

      <p>A bit bizarre, looks like it may be a temporary builders hut (Auf Wiedersehen?) for adjoining high rise developments &amp; has been left. Little character inside but does sell real ale. Close to Victoria Station</p>
