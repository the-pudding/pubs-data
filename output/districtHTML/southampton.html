[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/81563/" title="The main features in here for me was the Victorian wall and floor tiles. The pub has also retained the original butcher\'s rail system around the ceiling along with a couple of weighing apparatus. Their beers were on stillage at the rear of the pub, with no bar area. There was a young girl serving us on our visit, who poured your beers and took payment, she was very bubbly and chatty and was most interested in our little pub crawl around the area. Another quirky little piece of kit I noticed was their new addition of a wall mounted digital photo machine. So you can purchase an instant selfie for a quid and either stick it on the wall along with the locals, or take it away with you. Four cask ales on our visit, so we went for the Vibrant Forest Summerlands and the Goodens Gold, both of which were top class." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
