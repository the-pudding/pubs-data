A converted Hogs Head - so it had a very wine bar feel to it.  Even if they have added a dartboard.   All high stools, high tables and music far too loud for a tuesday with a smattering of punters.

Noticed Butty Bach and Golden Glow amongst the half dozen hand pulls and a notice board showing what was coming next.

Might need a return visit for the TT Landlord.

Golden Glow in great condition - and £2.70 a pint makes it the cheapest I\'ve bought for a long, long time." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
