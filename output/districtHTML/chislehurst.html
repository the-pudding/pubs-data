[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/15780/" title="This pleasant old pub close to Chislehurst station, has a lovely rustic feel to it that many pubs in the area seem to struggle to replicate. You enter directly to the main bar area in a carpeted L-shaped room with the similarly shaped servery to the left. The bar has a nice, curved dark wood counter, simple bar back and attractive gantry and extends through to a second room at the back of the pub. The main bar area has banquette seating around the perimeter with a few standard tables and chairs filing in the gaps. Red drapes adorn the windows and the walls have in places, been covered with some rather \'loud\' floral wallpaper. Muted lighting and various dark wood fixtures help create a nice ambience, aided by pleasant features such as the decorative light fittings and vases of fresh flowers on the tables. The rear room has more standard seating, this time arranged around a fireplace on the rear wall. It\'s a smaller space and was primarily being used by diners, although a few mouthy locals were stood at the bar here during the course of our visit. There is a formal restaurant out the back somewhere, seemingly decorated in quite an elaborate fashion, but we decided to take our food in the bar, which we soon regretted when the locals started swearing and shouting. To be fair, the bar staff put an end to this quite quickly, pointing out that there were still children present, which prompted one of the locals to give a grovelling apology to the child\'s father - a giant of a man who I most definitely wouldn\'t have wanted to upset!
The pub has featured in recent editions of the Good Beer Guide and had some well known ales on the bar, with Fullers London Pride, Harvey\'s Sussex Best and Marstons Pedigree available on this occasion. I gave the Sussex Best a try and it was in very good shape, so much so that I decided to have a second. We had a Sunday roast here and the food was very nice, as were the very attentive staff who seemed genuinely keen to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.
This is a nice traditional feeling pub that feels a lot more genuine and comfortable than other pubs I\'ve been to around Chislehurst. I was impressed with the friendly service and tasty food and thought the beer, whilst a little unadventurous, was at least in great condition. A good bet for a well kept pint in Chislehurst and a good double header with the nearby Rambler\'s Rest." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/15783/" title="Situated in the Southern corner of Chislehurst Common, a fairly short walk from the train station, this is an attractive looking clapboarded, two bar pub. Inside, you find a split level interior, with the lower lounge to the left on entering and the compact public bar to the right. The lounge has plush carpeting with smart banquette seating around the perimeter and standard chairs elsewhere. There are lots of dark wood beams and bulls eye windows around the room, to remind you that despite what appears to have been a fairly recent refit, this is still an old, traditional public house. The servery has an unusual padded frontage, a brass bar counter and a decent dark wood bar back. On the rear walls, two TV screens were showing the day\'s Formula One racing coverage with the sound just about audible over the chat from around the room. A few steps past the right hand end of the bar, take you up into the Public Bar with its own similarly styled servery, which most punters were stood around despite there being some nice fixed bench seats further back, serving copper topped tables. The decor in here seemed a bit more traditional with old paintings, salvers and other decorative items on show, We stopped off here for a bite to eat and found the food to be good hearty pub fayre with my Sunday roast being particularly tasty. The lower bar was fairly quiet when we arrived at around 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon, but soon filled out, generating a nice, relaxed atmosphere.
There were three ales available in the shape of Wells Bombardier, Fullers London Pride and a house beer called Ramblers Ale which I tried and thought might have been a rebadged Wells & Youngs beer. Whatever it was, it was kept well, despite the pub recently dropping out of the Good Beer Guide. The bar staff were a friendly and welcoming bunch and there was a mixed group of customers representing a good cross section of Chislehurst life.
I wasn\'t too sure what to expect from this place, but I thought it was a very pleasant pub that works well for both drinkers and diners alike. The two bar set up means that both groups have their own designated area in which to enjoy the well kept beer and tasty food and the friendly service is a welcome bonus. I can\'t say I know much about the pubs of Chislehurst, but I suspect there aren\'t too many that can better this one." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
