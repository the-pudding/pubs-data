[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/56279/" title="I popped in the Bransty Arch a bit over a week ago and as luck would have it they had the Wetherspoons Real Ale & Cider festival on.  This Spoons has 12 hand pulls in total, two banks of five plus an additional two clipped for cider at the time of my visit.  No duplications across the pumps, and all were on, so plenty to choose from.  A couple of the ciders took my fancy and they were an absolute bargain at £1 a half.

Can\'t really add much more than has already been said about the interior of the pub, it\'s an open plan place though it does give the illusion of separate sections.  There also seemed to be a small raised area to break it up a bit.

Have to say I was pretty impressed with this one, it\'s not the biggest Spoons in the world and had more hand pulls than I was expecting for the size of the place." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
