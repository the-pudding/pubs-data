[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/58604/" title="Formerly Missoula and before that the Living Room this is a huge place. It\'s had a massive refurbishment and now sells real ales and tank lager. On two levels there are loads of different types of seating, from comfy sofas, to benches and high stools. It also has a couple of outside area overlooking the Ouse, but these were plagued by wasps on our visit. 4 handpumps in use on our visit serving a decent selection of Yorkshire beers. It\'s a decent enough place of an afternoon, but may wells be full of students later." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
