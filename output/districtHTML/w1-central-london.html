[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/22242/" title="With views across the street to The Ritz,this small frontage Nicholson\'s is in prime tourist territory but standards have not slipped and it\'s one of the better ones in this chain.
The entrance area has a drinking shelf to the left and a huddle of tables and chairs below the front window.Further back the bar runs down the left side,while more seating is avaiable,some high tables then a large rear banquette as the ceiling gets lower.There is a first floor restaurant with it\'s own serving bar.
There are 8 handpuumps offering on my trip a large St Austell selection namely Hicks,Flanders & Firkin,Nicholson\'s Pale and Mandarin Bavaria (NBSS 3) along with Wild Beer PoGO and Black Sheep Velo Free Wheeling,plus a real cider.Deserves it\'s 2020 GBG listing.
There aren\'t too many real ale pubs in this part of town,this is a decent stop for ale and I will return." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
