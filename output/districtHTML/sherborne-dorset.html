[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87401/" title="The Brewed boy is the second tap for the Imaginary Friends Brewery, the other two being in Bath and Frome.  The Sherborne version is in an old commercial building which has been subdivided into a small trading estate, all the business sharing infrastructure including the car park.  It’s a small affair with some of the brewing plant at the back, hidden by a large cold store and a ceiling-mounted painted screen.  During the week you can by off-sales during the day, while the bar has very limited opening hours.  There are two wooden tables outside for al fresco drinking and for smokers, but it’s not an attractive place to sit as it’s in the actual car park.   The bar is at then side in the middle part of the space, all the taps, pipes and cooling equipment on display, and all the beers carbonated.   I had a pint of Space Ghost, a fairly refreshing lagered IPA, which tasted OK and had a hint of nettle about it. The beers are unnecessarily expensive for tap house, and they are over-chilled as well as over-gassed, though this is apparently how their target demographic – the hipster fraternity – like it.  The bearded troll behind the bar was unsociable, though the background music was good.  They also host live music on some evenings, so maybe it would be better then, but it’s not somewhere I’m desperate to revisit due to the prices and lack of welcome." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/64364/" title="Well hidden down a series of narrow country lanes, this superb village pub is well described internally by BF, below.  Outside there is a tiny car park and space for one or two cars on the road outside.  Two friendly dogs guard the back gate.  There is a pleasant garden with a smoking area and, on this occasion a marquee which is intended primarily to house their annual beer festival.  The staff were friendly, including the Marlon Dingle look-alike who appeared to be home from university for the Summer and was being gainfully employed.  Food looked very good though we didn’t eat.  Two ales on were Exmoor Ale and Steam Box Piston Broke.  The beer was in very good condition.  I’d be very happy indeed to come back here and will make an effort to visit the beer festival in future years." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
