West End brews... [<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/58909/" title="Brew pub with a pleasing exterior and well designed interior split into two sides,with the bar to the right.Well described below,it\'s laid back and calm compared with sports bar and student cheapo handouts elsewhere on Braunstone Gate.
West End brews will dominate and on my trip there was Tiramasu Poter,Project Pale (a little thin),West Coast IPA (not bursting with hops) with guests on Shipstone Bitter and Shiny Adventure.
I was underwhelmed by the West End brews although the barmans excellent refusal to allow a slow ordering punter to further add to his tortious ordering of a round once his change had been extracted from the till was pure class.He was told to order again once everyone else who he had held up was served,he was none too pleased about it but the outcome  was met with universal delight by everyone else.
Not enough here for me to plan a revisit,the Black Horse is still the go to pub in Braunstone Gate despite Everard repaint in light blue with trendy pub signs." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
