[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/24140/" title="There are four handpumps on the counter, but only one was in use dispensing Thwaite\'s Wainwright (£3.50 a pint). It was in excellent nick though. I saw a Sunday roast advertised, so I guess they must do food at other times, but I didn\'t see any sign of it during our midweek late afternoon visit. 

An Edwardian pub judging by the date (1906) on the exterior, covered with what looks like marble cladding at ground floor level. Inside the main room\'s on the right - this has the bar counter in it. To the front and rear left are two interconnected rooms reached by archways from the main bar area. The front one has a dartboard in it, and the back one has sofas in it and has more of a library feel about it; it also has a most interesting ancient framed map of the area on the chimney breast.

The main bar has a rank of chunky tall tables and tall stools down the right hand side by the window and one or two normal tables and chairs elsewhere. It\'s now bare-boarded, and the green lighting at the top of the bar back gave it an eerie look. All things considered, for me it didn\'t have the sort of warm feel I like in a pub on a dark, wet and cold January day. Only one other customer came in during our visit, but I hope it gets more customers later on in the evenings.

But that\'s just my opinion. On the plus side, the Wainwright was good." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
