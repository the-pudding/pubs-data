[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/3885/" title="I first visited the Pack Horse a couple of years ago for a private function, and had a bit of time yesterday so decided to call in as a bog standard customer.  Just after 5:30pm and there was a group on one of the tables in the sun out the front and a handful of locals in the bar.

Three hand pulls at the bar offering Boon Doggle, Hobgoblin and Exeter\'s County Best.  A different selection to my previous visit so I assume the beers must rotate.

Having just come from Libertys I found this to be a much more pleasant experience, it just felt friendly and what a proper local pub should feel like.  The beer choice isn\'t massively adventurous but my County Best was in good nick and a fairly decent bitter, so can\'t complain." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/3940/" title="This is another of Warrington\'s pubs that is blessed with a Regionally Important Historic Interior, so I called in before the match even though I knew there was no likelihood of getting any real ale. It was fairly busy, as may be imagined given how close to the ground this pub is situated. There was quite a press (nearly said scrum) around the bar counter that serves a sort of drinking corridor, so I made my way round to the front room and was served fairly quickly. This pub feels like a real blast from the past, as I must have been in countless pubs like this in the 70s and 80s, but the vast majority of them have either closed and been converted to flats or convenience stores, or have had the walls ripped out and become drinking barns. Definitely worth a visit on that score. Even though it means drinking something other than real ale.
