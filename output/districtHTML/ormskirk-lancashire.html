[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/66873/" title="A fine looking building which actually pre dates the Leeds & Liverpool Canal which runs outside.It was also a stopping place for fast moving packet boat services for passengers on their way to Liverpool by boat,hence the name.Little of the history remains internally,it has been opened out but still retains several sections.To the front right,there is a raised area with a flatscreen,in the main body there is a long banquette in red velour,while a mid building snug has a series of sofas with a rear section overlooking the canal has more conventional seating.
As has been mentioned the ale selection comes from Bank Top with three of the four pumps offering Flat Cap,Bad to the Bone and a very decent Pavilion Pale,although all three were of a similar ale style.
The food is well cooked and reasonably priced pub grub and the guv\'nor was both friendly and attentive.Both Sky and BT Sport are on the screens,and with live music on Saturdays this pub serves a gap in the local market.Along with the Hop Vine,this place is worth a visit if you like decent real ale." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
