[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/35692/" title="I think that this place might have improved a bit since previous reviewers\' visits. But it still looks like an Ember Inns pub even if it isn\'t one any more. It\'s the typical hotel lounge style of pub, with bucket armchairs and the like around the place. Inside there\'s an area to the left that\'s clearly for diners - tableclothes, napkins, wine glass - but it has to be said that the majority of the seating in this rambling pub seems to be available for those just wanting a drink. They must be doing something right as several tables were occupied y diners early afternoon on a Monday. The outside seating at the front, unfortunately adjacent to a main road, was also well patronised on a sunny and warm day in May. The outside seating to the side of the pub is still there, and didn\'t appear to be reserved for diners.

Unfortunately the beer\'s still nothing to write home about, with just London Pride on (£2.15 a half) which wasn\'t in great shape. I didn\'t get to see a menu as I steered well clear of the dining area, and nobody asked if I was dining with them today. Personally I think it\'s worth the five minute walk down to the Tubbs Pubb for a much better pint, but the outside seating has to be the main draw on a fine day." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/57472/" title="A busy and quite large roadside pub which has had several incarnations in the past but is now comfortably settled as an Ember Inn, with a Premier inn behind occupying what was once a large garden. The interior is in fairly standard Ember Inn modern style, although perhaps retaining more traces of the old pub than some do. Usual mixture of dining tables and high tables with stools, with a few useful corners to lurk in. One area to the side is labelled \'family dining\' but it is all much of a muchness. There are some tables out the front by the road, and a quieter patio area to the back. Draught ales include regularly changing guests alongside London Pride, Doom Bar and the house beer. Food not sampled but the Ember Inn menu is usually quite reliable. All in all quite pleasant, without being exceptional." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
