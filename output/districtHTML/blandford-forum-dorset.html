This is a bar where people can enjoy a quality cocktail award winning craft ale and enjoy the decor and atmosphere. This isn’t a pub but a great place to have a chat mingle and talk whilst having a award winning cocktail or two. When I was there I notice old and young talking to each other and having fun while think about what drink they were having next. I had a corbel which was £5.50 and a couple of old fashioned which were made to my requirements. The staff were very friendly and I had to move as they had a large party in last weekend and asked nicely if I would mind moving to another table 3 feet away with my friend, which wasn’t a problem. The atmosphere was really good and everyone was having fun. I can see why they were voted in the top three places to drink in the west last year in the ofm awards. I will be coming agin next week with more of my friends and telling everyone about this finden little gem. This is not a pub with old ales it is modern and stylish and not like any other bar in dorset" class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87832/" title="Housed on the first floor of one of Blandford’s historic high street buildings, this awful new bar feels like the bastard love-child of a Scout hut and a cheap vodka lounge.  It is reached through a wide, pleasant hall and a flight of stairs with a bearskin hanging on the wall.  The single room was the full height of the building’s upper story, reaching up into the roof rafters and lit by windows in the ceiling.  There was a back door that looked like it led to a smoking terrace.  The staff were fairly rude and unpleasant.  There was a mix of tables and seating arrangements, but clearly a game of musical chairs was being played out but with the music at a pitch we humans couldn’t hear, meaning the regulars got to sit down whenever a seat appeared but we didn’t.  The food just looked awful, but then it wasn’t aimed at normal people so maybe it was OK for its intended demography.   There was no real ale and no bottled beer, so we settled for Eight Arch craft beer which was overchilled (presumably to make the Neanderthal at the bar feel at home) and tasteless, and retailed at £6.00 a pint.  There was nothing here any self-respecting Norseman would find worth drinking – their main effort goes into naff cocktails and prosecco – so I really have no inclination to return." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
