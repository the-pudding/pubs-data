[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/39470/" title="A \"free house\" operated by the expanding Big Smoke Brewery; sufficiently free in fact to have only one of their own ales on the pumps. 4 others were available, including Harvey\'s, but there were a few unclipped as well on this Saturday afternoon visit. I failed to take note of the keg offerings. Music was being played from a vinyl selection.

While the service at the bar and table was professional and friendly, I thought that The Hole In The Wall fell some way short of the standards set by their homeground pubs in South West London." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/86369/" title="A typical single room micro - half-a-dozen or so 3-4 seater tables and a small shelf downstairs, as well as whatever is \"upstairs\" - there were a few takers.

The ale, as usual, was served from a cool room behind the bar and, as is often the case, a little lifeless as a result. There\'s also 4 craft keg (3 from Holler on my visit), amusingly described in the beer menus as \"evil keg\". Also, a good selection of wines and cans and draft beer to take away.

The room was well sound-proofed from the constant traffic on the road outside, which made for a pleasant and relaxing hour or so. The beer\'s good and interesting with a good buzz in the room, so it\'s one to visit in the county town." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
