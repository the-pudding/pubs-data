Part of the Black Country Ales Chain.  Like the Wellington in Brum, there\'s TV screens showing the 11 or so real ales on.

This has a real pubby feel.  Multiple houses knocked together, providing some side rooms complete with real fire.   Bar is long, thin and has a wickedly sloping floor.

BCA seem to source very unusual brews and I had a fine Black Storm Porter - all the way from Whitby to the West Midlands.

Perfect Pub." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
