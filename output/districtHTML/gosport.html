[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87485/" title="The Brewery tap is a simple single room in the modern industrial unit. There is a solitary toilet, no food, just beer.  The bar has a small wooden counter, a rack of large beer bottles and various certificates and citations around the walls.  The bar furniture consists of a large wooden cable drum on its side used as a table and seats made from old aluminium beer barrels.  There is a large window through which you can see the brewery working and the ales for the bar on stillage.  I had the first pint of Texas Red from a newly tapped barrel, which was of course in perfect condition.  I had a chat with one of the staff who was knowledgeable, friendly and helpful.  Well worth finding for its beer, but check the website for opening times before you travel." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
