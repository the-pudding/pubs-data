[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/23094/" title="This is a former Charrington’s pub which has retained its excellent façade, including original tiling and the Toby House sign, located at the Southern end of Brompton Road. The pub has a wide but shallow interior with doors at either end leading you in to the same simple room with the servery along the mid-part of the rear wall. The room has dark floorboards, plain windows along the front wall and a full height mirrored wall to the right which makes the pub appear a lot bigger than it really is. There are limited tables and chairs at either end of the room, plus a few short, button backed banquettes, with the only options being the row of high stools along a drinking ledge under the front windows. The bar has a square ended, dark wood counter, impressive modern gantry and basic mirrored bar back, all embellished with a fancy looking coffee machine and a spectacular bouquet of flowers. A TV screen on the right-hand wall remained turned off throughout the course of my visit, despite a high-profile Chelsea fixture taking place at that very moment in time, suggesting live sports coverage is unlikely. The left side of the room has a few old local photos on the walls alongside a nice Charrington’s mirror, a rather bleak and solitary painting and a small book swap scheme.
There are four handpulls which had a line-up of Harviestoun Bitter and Twisted, Fullers London pride and Wimbledon Copper Leaf (£5.00) on this visit. The friendly barman served up a pretty good pint of the Copper leaf and I noted that the keg lines also included several Harviestoun beers, whilst lots of their promotional material could be seen around the room, suggesting they may have some sorts of link to the brewery.
I liked this pleasant, uncomplicated pub with its fantastic exterior, unfussy interior and decent, well-kept ale range. The pub felt a lot more homely and welcoming than a lot of the other pubs in this part of town and I was glad I went out of my way to check it out." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/23087/" title="It was a relief to actually see a pub after walking a fair bit down the King\'s Road, passing a multitude of designer outlets. The pub was busy on our Thursday eve visit, with a good few of the drinkers sitting outside, along the side street entrance. This is a one room pub, which was traditional in style, with the main feature being the front bay windows. The pub was well staffed behind the bar and in spite of the pub being busy, the staff took their time serving you and treating you as an individual and not a number, which I liked. Five handpumps with three ales on our visit, London Glory, Abbott and Sambrooke\'s Pumphouse Pale. We went for the latter, which was in excellent condition and cost a whopping £5.10, unfortunately it was my round." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
