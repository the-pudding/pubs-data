[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/13434/" title="As described below this Georgian village pub serves both its locals and visitors to the nearby castle.  It’s currently owned by Enterprise, and it’s primarily food led, giving it the feel of a GK or ‘Spoons but slightly better.  The food is average pub grub plus Sunday carvery and a fairly decent specials board.  The reception wasn’t particularly warm, but then they were busy with families so I can’t moan too much.  There is a single large, open plan bar with plenty of room for drinkers, diners and dogs.  Ales on were Fullers Gales HSB, Seafarer’s, Doombar and Proper Job, plus there was a dry pump.  No real cider was available.  OK for refreshments when in the area and certainly a step up from the other pubs in Portchester." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
