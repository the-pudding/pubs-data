No till at the bar and I paid my £5.40 (!!!) for a Peak Ales Swift Nick to the receptionist.

      <p>Open at 11am for a drink, which was good news. But bring your money - &pound;4.85 for Timothy Taylor Landlord.

Nice country pub but nothing to justify the costs.

Catering (and ripping off) the tourists at Chatsworth, I would imagine.</p>
