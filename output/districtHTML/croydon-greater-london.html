[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/35541/" title="ORIGINAL REVIEW Jan 2011.

As others have mentioned ,this looks a typical Spoons but with  an  increasing focus on a decent range of ale.10 handpumps with three usual suspects London Pride,GK Abbott,and \"Ruddles\" bitter pleasingly augmented on my trip by Thornbridge Jaipur IPA and Kipling,three Dark Star brews (Hophead,Meltdown and Festival) together with Abbott Reserve and Dorking Brewery\'s DB Number One.
The front of the pub is more earthy and has a pubby feel.There are large pillars on both left and right handsides breaking up an otherwise large area into sections and this is where the drinkers congregate,near the front bar.Beyond here is a raised dining area which extends well back into the building with ranks of dining tables and some alcoves on both sides.It is however worth investigating the Top bar ,at the back of the building as the handpumps here carry beers not found at the front bar,usually two Dark Star brews.
You will be hard pressed to find lower alcohol prices anywhere else in Croydon .The beer variety and quality makes this a good place to include in any crawl around Croydon ,which over the years has developed a good real ale scene.

UPDATE

Oh dear.The old team have left ,and with them all hope of getting outstanding ale.The new management team no longer stock as regulars Burning Sky Aurora,Plateau or Thornbridge Jaipur although these are listed as regulars in the 2020 GBG.No sign either of ales from Oakham,Saltaire or high class Locales.Instead besides the trio of Doom,the other 12 handpumps will offer beers sourced under the very low Wetherspoons \"clearing price\" for a barrel meaning they will only offer as guests beer that is difficult to sell elsewhere.On my trip there was a 5% malty mess,another beer at 4.5% and 10 ales between 3.8% and 4.3% with little of any interest.This is now a bog standard \'spoons and not worthy of making any special effort to visit.A very sad day." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
