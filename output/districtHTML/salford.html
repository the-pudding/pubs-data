[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/13145/" title="A Historic pub opened in the 1870\'s, replacing an earlier King Arms built in 1807 on the opposite side of the street. We called in here on a Thursday afternoon, so the pub was fairly quiet, which gave a good opportunity to meet the new owner, a very friendly girl who bought the pub from Paul Heaton of the Housemartins/Beautiful South over a year ago. Delighted that we took a big interest in the pub, she allowed us to visit the recently restored Victorian Theatre at the top of the building. Other prominent features included the small lounge found on the left of the entrance and the main bar/lounge area and not forgetting the resident pub cat, Charlie.
Six ales on handpump, so we went for the House Beer brewed by Outstanding Brewery, another from Outstanding Brewery, Queen\'s Legs, and Beartown Crème Bearlee. All the beers were in excellent shape and the prices were reasonable." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/81346/" title="This large modern bar, part of a small chain which also includes its namesake in Spinningfields, has a prominent location next to the BBC’s Media City complex on  Salford Quays. The pub comprises one single, vast, concrete floored room with a large servery to the rear and a long row of wooden pillars through the centre which help to break things up a little. The bar has a nice counter which has been made to make it look like a beer barrel and behind this is a high bar back which incorporates a blackboard listing the full beer range. The large front windows have padded banquettes beneath them, each formed into pleasant looking booths, whilst the pillars behind these have high stools and drinking ledges around them. To either side of the room, mixed seating options appear, including lots of regular tables and chairs that are ideal for those wanting to eat, and a raised platform to the left with some sofas on it. Entertainment comes in the form of a table football game in the front left corner, which a group of children were certainly getting their money’s worth from on our visit, whilst a massive screen on one wall was showing a muted kids movie, also viewable from a number of smaller screens dotted around the room. There’s a nice fireplace in a central position near the entrance which helped warm punters up on a bitterly cold winter’s evening and an open kitchen to the rear right also offer the hope of some residual heat. For warmer months, a good deal of bench seating is available outside the front of the pub.
The welcome sight of a long row of handpulls greeted us at the bar, with the options on this occasion comprising Great Heck Chopper, Titanic Plum Porter Reserve, Cross Bay Buddy, Tiny Rebel Stay Puft, Lancaster Blonde and a house beer called Dockyard Ale, of unknown provenance. Added to this, a great craft keg range was also available along with several bottle or can options. I tried the Stay Puft, which was probably on its way out, and my other half enjoyed one of their ciders.
This is a pretty good, modern bar that suffers a little from feeling like a drinking barn, but was helped by a good crowd who created a nice atmosphere, in spite of the fact that there were a lot of noisy kids tearing around the place. This place looked far preferable to the other bars I saw around the Quays development and would be my venue of choice if I were to venture back this way again." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
