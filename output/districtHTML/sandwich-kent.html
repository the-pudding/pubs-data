[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/16736/" title="The Red Cow is to the west of central Sandwich and overlooks the Guildhall car park which in former years was the towns cattle market, which may explain the name of the pub, and you can’t miss it from the outside due to the large red cow on the front of the pub as well as the pub name.
Internally it is another fine traditional decor with what looks like original black wall and ceiling beams throughout. It looks like it was formerly several rooms but now one internal space with the remaining wall beams providing divides between different areas of the pub. One section with red flag tiled flooring and an impressive brick fireplace is used for dining, another closer to the bar has a bar billiards table in situ and then the slate coloured stone floored bar room with its thin servery lined with bar stools leads out to a spacious, yet secluded external garden area.
Six ale pumps on the bar and there were four ales available for our visit in the shape of Fullers London Pride, Long man Brewery American Pale Ale, Timothy Taylor Knowle Spring and Old Dairy Brewery Coppertop. One pump was unused and the final one had been Ramsgate Brewery Gadds no.3 but reversed. We tried the Long Mann and Old Dairy brews and they were well kept." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/16729/" title="In addition to the main market square area of Sandwich, the other area with a bit of life is at the intersection of the High Street and the Quay. As well as a few decent restaurants along the Quay here you will find the Bell Hotel, the sadly currently closed Admiral Owen and the Crispin Inn.
The Crispin Inn is an interesting pub of clearly some substantial age, especially as it is joined to the historic Barbican toll bridge gate house, which dates from the 14th century and is the only remaining gate house from the towns historic defensive wall when it used to be on the coast.
It is best entered from the High street entrance as this brings you to the pleasant traditional beamed main bar and separate snug area to the left of the bar. We actually entered from the quay side where you have to walk through the covered outside courtyard drinking area and then snake through the fairly plain dining room area which initially gives first time visitors the feeling that you have made a bit of a mistake coming here, until you finally find the bar.
The low ceiling, bare floor and brick walled bar has a homely feel and the furniture here has clearly seen some life. The bar itself, which sports a particularly fine display of Kentish hops along the bar top has six ale and cider pumps. One was not in use and with Old Rosie Cloudy Cider on one this left four ales on in the shape of Harvey’s Sussex Best, Timothy Taylor Knowle Spring and two badged Crispin Ale and Crispin Pale Ale which are brewed by the Nearby Mad Cat Brewery near Faversham. We tried both the Mad Cat brews and they were decent enough and served in good condition.
It was a fine day so we took our beers outside. Unfortunately the covered courtyard doesn’t seem to get the sun but there are a couple of external metal tables and chairs placed riverside on the other side of the Fisherman’s Wharf and we managed to get one of these in this pleasant spot, and whilst there also enjoyed the spectacle of the road swing bridge being opened to let a sailing craft go down the River Stour." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
