[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/60896/" title="My first visit for about 25 years (except to take a photograph at a time when the pub was not open). Today I had been on a strenuous walk with my daughter and we were in need of liquid refreshment; the new owners have thoughtfully provided a serve-yourself water cooler next to the bar. First impressions were that the pub had been drastically made over since the previous review, with nothing traditional remaining. To be fair, the emphasis on stone, wood and plain painted walls has been tastefully done, so it is with a heavy heart that I have to report that we were greeted with a very loud blast of \"Get yer rocks off, honey\" on the music system. Other dross followed, to be replaced, thankfully, after about 20 minutes with That\'s Entertainment by The Jam. Is there a vegetarian version of \"one man\'s meat is another man\'s poison\"? I suppose someone, somewhere must actually like Def Leppard. The debate about background music continues.

Anyway, a description of the pub: we entered through the side door, which gives immediate access to the toilets (including wheelchair access) in a short corridor ahead; to the right a ramp leading down to a small area with a few chairs and tables, which at the time of our arrival was occupied by two dogs and their attendant humans (the latter in the chairs, obviously); further on is the bar area in the centre of the pub, with what could almost be a drinking corridor in front; further on still to the right hand side of the pub (which can also be accessed via the front door) is the largest part, having wooden tables, benches, chairs and stools. 

Returning to the nub of the matter: the bar. This has four hand pumps with an interesting selection of beers in what I propose to assume are carefully chosen contrasting styles: local Whim Hartington IPA and Slaters 1 Hop, plus two Celtic interlopers in Tiny Rebel Cwtch from Cymru and Skinners Betty Stogs from Kernow. I went for the Slaters, which I admit to having drunk under its previous name of [can\'t bring myself to type it, sorry], and which although a little on the cold side was in excellent condition.

The bar staff were two young women who were friendly and welcoming. During an otherwise slack period, they were entertaining two equally young men by reading out quiz questions, to which they then gave hilariously wrong answers but which me and my daughter then gave the correct answers to. That\'s entertainment, I suppose." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/60893/" title="A very nice single roomed pub, obviously opened out from something with several smaller rooms at one time. The bar is immediately in front on entering, with a real fire to the left. There\'s some very nice furniture and there were three or four other customers at the time of my visit, which was shortly before the afternoon close (2:30 to 6pm) which applies every day except Sunday. There are six hand pumps with Pedigree doubled, plus Wincle Challenger and Old Golden Hen. I went for the Wincle, one of their single hop series, and this was a very nice drink. This pub is out of the way but not far from Carsington water, so probably attracts weekend visitors and summer tourists. I quite liked it here and wouldn\'t mind calling in again.
