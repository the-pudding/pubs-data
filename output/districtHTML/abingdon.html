[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/55407/" title="Ancient (C.17 coaching inn) back-of-the-cobbled-courtyard pub. Quite large and atmospheric inside, with two bars. Knocked-through and modernised (£1.8 million in 2013, apparently!) with some character injected to replace what was. There are three distinct areas; a central bar, a room with exposed stone walls and dog legged red walled room with pictures on the walls. Three pumps, all on; Fullers Swing Low, Fullers London Pride and Loose Cannon Singing in the Grain – the latter of which was in pretty good nick. I quite liked it here, worth a visit. Look out for the cannon in the courtyard." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
