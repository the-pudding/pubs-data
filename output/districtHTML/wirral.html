[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/86894/" title="A good sized one roomed micro pub that was a former mountain bike shop. The interior was modern and has been finished to a high standard. The bar area is situated mid way along the right hand side, which gives plenty of seating space along the front and down the left hand side. The bar area had an oak counter top and dark green painted bar front which matched the painted feature wall opposite. The bar area also had some coat hooks along the front and a foot rest, trendy copper pendant lamps hanging above the counter were a good feature. The flooring was polished timber and the seating was low tables, plus some bar stools along the counter.
Three ales on handpump on my visit, Peerless Skyline, Brimstage Trapper\'s Hat and Liverpool Brewing Cascade. Five craft beers, a fridge full of Belgian beers and a choice of 24 cans and bottles, which were displayed on a chalk board behind the bar. The barmaid was welcoming and chatty and offered samples of all their three cask ales." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
