This is a very fine example of a micro pub,there is lots of light in this former shop unit but the frosted glass means you retain some privacy while sampling the fine real ale.There is a bench seat along one wall,sensible sized tables on both sides,a small bench opposite the bar and room for vertical drinking while chatting to the guv\'nor.The dark wood floor completed the scene.The number of barrels racked in the temperature controlled stillage has been increased which means you may have up to 5 choices,and Red Squirrel/Mad Squirrel now features large besides LBB so lots of Locale choice.My Mad Squirrel APA and LBB Rebel Yell were on top form.There is a selection of real ciders,wine,nuts,pork pies,scotch eggs,ploughmans,cheeses and toasties which all seemed the perfect accompanyment to the ale.The generous landlady also brought out some free snacks which was a lovely touch and naturally we got chatting.Conversation rules the roost here and it\'s very dog friendly so there are lots of people popping in and out .Due to a lack of economies of scale,this micropub doesnt charge micro prices but is in line with local pub ale pricing and hopefully is sustainable as such.A must visit in Leighton Buzzard and one of the best micro pubs I\'ve visited in the UK.Recommended.

UPDATE
This is now the go to pub when in Leighton Buzzard and the ale selection had got better and better every year.The ale conditioning is perfect and by looking at the pump clip collection on the walls you can tell that only the very best brewers will feature here.Expect a real treat on Fridays when Oakham Green Devil IPA will appear ,and then disappear quickly ! Vinyl is discretely played at low volume from a turntable.Expect real ale discussion of the highest order with the guv\'nor.Upgraded to full marks from me,an absolute must visit and stay a while to really enjoy." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
