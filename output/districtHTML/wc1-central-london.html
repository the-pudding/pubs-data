[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/22033/" title="An impressive street corner Victorian pub,the doors marked Saloon and Public Bar hint at a former layout,these days it\'s open plan but with a raised section opposite the bar,and a lower ceiling section at the rear with a bench seat.The interior is dark with lots of wood panelling,drapes and slats covering the top half of the large windows which partially obscures some good stained glass.The glazed tiled fireplace looks operational.The overall feel is traditional,even plush in parts.The flatscreens were playing BBC News on mute while the muzak was a touch too loud.
It\'s in the 2020 GBG and has three handpumps offering Three Sods Session IPA,GK Old Golden Hen and St Austell Proper Job (£3.75 ,NBSS 3.5).The food offering is very reasonable for the area with small plates,wraps and baguettes £6,mains £9-£12.
If you are waiting for a train at St Pancras,this pub may well work.Good for a quick one but maybe not the ale range for a long session." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
