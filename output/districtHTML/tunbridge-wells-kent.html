[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/66363/" title="This is a fairly simple Greene King pub located just across the road from Tunbridge Wells station, but as uninspiring as that may sound, there is a redeeming feature in the shape of twelve handpulls, of which nine were in action on my late Friday night visit. These options amounted to Greene King IPA, Belhaven Bedford Steam Best Bitter, Laine Breaker and Merry Berry, Wantsum Citra and Montgomery, Musket Fife & Drum and Iron Pier Bitter, with a pump dedicated to a real cider option as well. My pint of the Citra was in pretty good shape and served to me by one of the attentive team of bar staff who seemed upbeat even at the end of the Friday night shift.
The pub has a fairly no frills, single room set-up, with a bare boarded room, whitewashed walls plus a section of ‘fake’ brickwork to the front, and the servery along the mid-section of the left hand wall. Some nice banquette seating has been provided either side of the entrance, aided by some standard chairs to create a couple of decent, mid-size seating areas. High tables further into the room, give way to more basic tables and chairs and a few short sofas. A small performance space in the rear right corner was occupied by a rather dull local band playing covers with a good degree of ineptitude as well as a few of their own tuneless numbers, whilst a plasma screen above them remained stubbornly switched off, which was a shame as it would’ve provided much more entertainment. Beyond the end of the bar, there is a small area with a couple more tables for those keen for a bit of privacy. The bar itself has a fairly standard tongue and groove counter – a theme throughout Tunbridge Wells it would seem – a modern bar back and metal frame pot shelf. A dartboard to the left of the bar had a shelf full of board games next to it as well as a TV screen showing muted music videos. Boards next to the stage list the ales available, but they are blocked by a pillar when you’re stood near the bar, so consultation is required prior to approaching the bar.
This was a decent enough pub in which to round out my crawl around Tunbridge Wells, its proximity to the station making it perfect for exactly that purpose. The wide ale range makes it a tempting option, although it would be interesting to know whether they’re able to maintain quality across so many handpulls at all times. A slightly characterless place, but certainly worthy of a look." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/53089/" title="This is a very basic, traditional side street boozer located up a rather steep side road off the main High Street. The pub has a simple bare boarded interior with the servery along much of the right hand wall. The front part of the pub is dominated by a popular pool table that various people seemed to be queued up to play on, arguably detracting from the pub’s traditional feel but clearly helping to pull a few extra punters through the door. The bar has a plain tongue and groove counter with a similar bar back that features a promising looking ‘Coming Soon’ ale list. The pool table means that seating is forced along the left side of the room, with some small tables and low stools opposite the bar, broken by a tidy brick fireplace with a plain mirror above and various certificates and other items relating to the pub’s charitable work to one side. There’s a sofa in the rear left corner under a flat screen TV which was turned off on this visit, with a slot machine and small table rounding out the furniture at the back of the room. Playing cards and traditional games can be found in a window sill back here and the decor includes a shelf full of rugby and whiskey themed items as well as some unusual clocks made from old 7” records, which should not be taken as a hint towards the pub’s music policy though – there was no piped music playing at all throughout the course of my stay.
The aforementioned ‘Coming Soon’ board hints towards the pub’s commitment to real ale and they had four active handpulls on the go when I arrived, dispensing Taylors Landlord, Harvey’s Sussex Best, Marston’s EPA and a Pale Ale from a brewery I failed to note. The EPA was in pretty decent shape and set me back £4.00 for a pint, which seems to be about par for the course in these parts.
I liked this pub which made up for a fairly mainstream ale selection by creating a pleasant environment in which to relax over a few pints. The staff were very friendly and the pub had that feel to it that makes you think it will always offer a warm welcome to a stranger. I only had a rushed visit here, but I’d certainly be more than happy to return, as it fitted in nicely with the other pubs on my crawl." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
