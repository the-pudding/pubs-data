Renamed the Buxton in 2019, perhaps after nearby Buxton Street, part of Truman, Hanbury & Buxton, local brewers who constructed the Eagle brewery to the north along Brick Lane.
This in now a 15-room hotel with the pub - if you can call it that - serving as hotel bar, albeit a public one and rudimentary check-in facility for guests. Nothing of the original survives, apart from a small attractive tiled Victorian fireplace, with the bar now centrally located and seemingly doubling with an open kitchen. There\'s food, but hardly pub grub as it includes the likes of rabbit rillettes with pork and prune terrine and saucisse seche, for 8 Units.  Walls are bare brick painted white (with exposed electrical boxes); windows are bi-fold. The floor is now covered with large pale grey ceramic tiles with a bar apron of small mosaic tiles. The ceiling is clad with strange fibrous tiles which look as though they\'ve been made from compressed spaghetti, painted grey. Above the bar is a tubular steel gantry but the remainder of the pub seems to have a not unattractive Art Deco theme, which must have cost a packet. The bar is inverse tiered with a marble top and there are two high lacquered curved tables with pale inlay which project out from the wall. Lighting comprises fairly conventional opaque spherical hanging lamps with some gas discharge tubular Deco-style lamps to the perimeter which is partially clad in Deco-inspired mirrors. Seating comprises some fairly smart tall stools to the tables with attractive plywood stools to the small bar, which seated a total of just three customers who were hotel guests; piped music was of the Yacht Rock variety, as you\'d expect in a wine bar.
An efficient barmaid presided over Sharp\'s Atlantic and Anspach & Hobday\'s London ESB at £5.00 a pint and very decent it was too though very expensive.
This is an odd place, especially given its location on the cusp of Brick Lane\'s Curry Mile: it\'s not exactly comfortable or homely so can\'t imagine anyone making an effort to visit and as it\'s not a style bar, I can\'t see it appealing to the area\'s recently arrived young and fashionable. It does however have a certain curiosity value." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
