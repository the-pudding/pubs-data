[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/27808/" title="This pub certainly takes advantage of its enviable location right on Teddington Lock and at the end of the footbridge over the river and lock. The garden (if the word covers it) is absolutely enormous and on a fine late June day tables were at a premium. Split into various areas, including \"The Beach\" as well as table tennis and also a childrens\' play area, I have to say it was very well presented, tidy and efficiently managed going so far as to have smoking and non-smoking areas, a genuine plus when so many pubs\' outdoor areas are now basically al-fresco smoking sections.
Inside the pub is tidy and has the fresh look of a recent makeover. There are separate small areas such as \"The Library\" each with an individual style. The aforementioned area has a full wall diamond pigeon hole bookcase with second hand books free for a charity donation. A front area has TV and film memorabilia such as film cans, lighting rigs and stills from the various shows and comedies that were filmed at the former Teddington Studios which stood nearby. An upstairs function room is \"The Reel Room\". There are a couple of maps of the River Thames on the wall and across a brick chimney breast and an area has wall mounted oars and other boating equipment. I spotted a couple of stuffed fish in cases.
Food is a major part of the operation and a conservatory and a further side area were set for dining however people were mostly eating informally elsewhere and outdoors. The beers were Pride, Dark Star Revelation plus American Pale Ale and Castle Rock Songbird. No sign of any of the other regular Fullers beers on cask. An ok spot especially when the sun is shining." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/27817/" title="I popped in here for a quick half due to a train delay, my first visit for a few years when it was previously known as The Bloated Mallard. The new incarnation and return to the original name is a considerable improvement on that nonsense, I received a friendly welcome from the (French?) barman and the three handpumps are now clipped and functioning although one was reversed. Doom Bar and Wandle were on. 
The pub has an island bar, the room is fairly long and narrow, boarded floor, open through fireplace with a log fire which was very welcome on a horrible wet and windy afternoon. Chalkboards listed an extensive wine selection plus a daily food menu, certainly not your pub grub, much more upmarket, mains from £10.50 to £16.
The bar counter front has white tiles, there is some exposed brickwork, seating is of the regular type as you\'d expect in a foody place, white candles on the window cills, clear glass windows with stained glass upper sections. Stairs lead up to the toilets and a function room which can be hired. There is a TV so perhaps sporting events are shown but this was off on Friday pm.
It is still upmarket and foody but certainly much less pretentious and well worth popping in for a pint especially if the trains are up the creek as they were on the day." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
