[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87691/" title="This recently opened (April 19) micropub occupies a former florists and is only open noon til 10pm on Thursdays to Saturdays.It\'s currently a work in progress,but a welcome addition to the Hertford drinking scene.
You enter into a stripped out front room with an unused small fireplace to the right,slate flooring and just two high tables in either window recess,with plastic high stools .Clearly there is potential for more seating.There is a chalk board indicating some of the brewers that might be featured and a collection of pump clips testifying to the constantly rotating nature of the beer choice.
Down a step is a small tap room with a bar to the right on which 9 taps are arranged,room here only for vertical drinking.The chalk board here has more info. on the beer choice,but I was informed it was not up to date which seemed a schoolboy error for a wet let micropub.I was told that three of the taps were key keg,while two methods of top pressure were used to dispense the keg beers,this would have been very useful additional information on the chalkboard for any real ale fans.
The upstairs room will be for gamers and I didn\'t venture up there.
Beyond the bar,there is a wide corridor with drinking shelves fitted but strangely no seating, leading to the lavatory and a door to a courtyard with empty barrels but sadly lots of other detritus.If cleared up,this could be a very attractive external drinking (and smoking ) area.
A big effort has been made to get some interesting beer and sparkling cider in,it\'s very much craft at craft prices.The choice will rotate and the best option is to consult the website.My Cloudwater #www.oooooo.ddd was a good key keg smoked 7.2% er,and came in at £6.75.Other prices were generally >£4 so it will be interesting to see if this price point works for the drinkers of Hertford,but I applaud the effort made here to bring something different to town and wish the operation well.I will return over the months ahead to see developments,maybe some sharp edges will have weathered in by then." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/64456/" title="The next-door Quiet Man was rammed for a PL match, so I skipped that and went next door to this which is no longer an American diner, rather a bar with Banksy/Basquiat-style art on the wooden-slated walls. Bare boards too, and standard tables and chairs with the former having faux-marble tops. No real ale, although I did get close - a 500ml bottle of Adnam\'s Southwold Bitter was £4.60 for the honour. A DJ was playing some 80s Soul tunes from an iMac in one of the corners and I\'m pretty sure one of the party of women on a table near me, who ended up getting up and boogieing was ex-Eastenders actress Gillian Taylforth. An extra point for the 80s/90s soap star spot." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
