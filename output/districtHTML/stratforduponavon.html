[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/37324/" title="A roadside village pub on the old A34, once a major trunk route from the South Coast ports to the Midland and North.  It\'s a very pleasant, traditional stone floors and exposed beams affair which has somehow avoided the depredations of the gastro brigade, and seems little changed from 30 or 40 years ago.  The main room, to the front, comprises three distinct areas, bar and fireplace in the middle with a dining room to the right.  And there is, holy of holies, a public bar to the rear complete with pool table and telly.  Plenty of places to sit outside with views of an eyesore of a carpark.

Spot on Mad Goose served with a smile.  One of the better options along here and well worth a stop if you\'re doing the Oxford-Woodstock-Stratford circuit." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
