[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/66153/" title="After the much heralded transfer to their managed estate Enterprise have quietly let this one slide back into their sink estate. This has also coincided with the reduction of five hand pumps to two and the fact that they no longer bother to even stock real ale. This is enough to reduce the score to two without going there. A visit would almost certainly result in the Score of Shame.
No doubt we can now look forward to the same old cycle of tenant walk-outs, closures and reopenings before they just give up and it goes the same way as the other two Friday Hill pubs. The difficulty there is that this is the only pub left in the area, a fact that won\'t have escaped the attention of the Council, local residents and the CAMRA branch.
This place is a testimony to what a hapless shower Enterprise Inns are. It\'s a nice building in a quiet but pleasant location. Maybe its troubled past is just too much for it to cope with. 

Visit September 2014

After years of causing a headache for Enterprise Inns it would seem that they have finally got shot of this place. 
It is now owned and operated by the Bermondsey Pub Company which is the managed house division of er, Enterprise Inns! 

Having been known as the Sirloin, the Forest Edge then back to the Sirloin it is now the Dovecote. There is a large Hall in nearby Simmons Lane that has a listed Dovecote building in the grounds which is where the new name comes from.
Perhaps it\'s just as well that they didn\'t name the pub after the Hall as it\'s called Pimp Hall. 

It\'s now a single bar that\'s been given a decent enough makeover that isn\'t an Islington template but does have some fireplaces and exposed brick sections. There is a car park and a pleasant looking garden. The bar now sports five pumps which should have been dispensing Doom Bore, GK London Glory, Adnam\'s Broadside, London Pride and Otter Ale but because the Doom Bore and Otter were off there were only three. I tried the London Glory (£3.50) which was in good condition. 
My problem with this place is that this beer selection is mainstream and boring and at the price gives me no incentive to return. I had a quick glance at the food menu and noticed a mixed grill was priced at £13.95. I had something similar in the Wolverhampton Spoons on Saturday and it was only £8.70 which included a premium guest locale Beowulf ale which would have cost £2.20.
It might be handy if you live nearby, but I see no reason to return here. Score 5." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
