[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/40554/" title="After a good walk around Hardcastle Crags, the ‘aleandhearty’ family were definitely in need of a beer or two. Unfortunately, our preferred choices in Hebden town centre were closed and so we made a spontaneous detour out to the Fox & Goose and were so glad we did. It’s a cracking traditional, stone floored, three roomer, probably best described as having an unpretentious cosiness. 

At the bar, six ales were on offer and the four I tried: Red Willow ‘Headless’ & ‘Faithless’, Magpie ‘One for Sorrow’ and Pictish ‘Brewer’s Gold’ were all in excellent condition. Service from the barman was friendly and welcoming and there was a surprisingly good atmosphere on our Tuesday afternoon visit, with about a dozen other punters in the place.

Our visit coincided with the freakish, late-February, summery weather and so, rather than sit inside, we took the staircase, to the left of the bar, up to the hillside beer garden, just to the side of the pub. It was lovely to drink beer in the warm sunshine, but rather unsettling to see the sun dropping down over the far side of the valley, at 4.30 in the afternoon, when it felt like June!

As a family, we all loved this place and will undoubtedly return in the future. Fans of ‘proper’ traditional pubs will definitely find something to enjoy here." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
