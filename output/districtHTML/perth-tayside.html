Maybe but there\'s not much remaining of anything old inside. Piped music, which is not too intrusive and big screens. At least there is bench seating. A forest of keg taps at one end, three pulls in the middle, Jarl, Schallion and a House badged one presumably from owners Belhaven. More pub like than many Scots bars and not an exclusively male preserve.

It\'s not much larger than a decent sized micropub and is a rectangular room with the bar at the back. The ceiling is the usual unfinished thing but one big plus is that there are no TVs. One of the things that struck me here was the varied clientele which on a Friday afternoon was older than my preconceptions about Brewdog pub. 
There is no cask but 14 keg taps which had a Hawkes low abv cider then a roughly equal split between Brewdog regulars, Brewdog seasonal and Northern Monk guests. There is also a fridge with assorted cans and bottles.
With an extended stay I tried 7 offerings all of which were not too gassy or cold and of varying styles. On the face of it they were expensive but I was with a shareholder which gave 10% discount and the final receipt showed a 15% daytime discount making the prices reasonable for Scotland.
It may not be \"proper\" real ale in here but with the two discounts this is easily the best venue in Central Perth." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
