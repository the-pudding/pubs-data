[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/61888/" title="The Anchor Inn is a picturesque road side pub, on a busy main road, it is now under new management. They are serving hot food and filled rolls, I had a cheese and pickle roll which was generously filled, fresh and tasty. I cannot comment on the drinks selection, because I ordered a diet coke. The Anchor has the feel of a proper traditional pub, without the bells and whistles – which is fine by me. If I am in the area again, I might call in and try something from the food menu." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87595/" title="A recently opened micropub in a shop unit that was until recently an estate agents, there is a decent amount of outside seating on the wide pavement, and unlike many micropubs, it is split in to two rooms with a small snug at the front. The windows were etched with the pub’s name, and on entering in to a small vestibule, further etched glass doors led off to the right to the snug, and straight on to the “Tap Room”.

Internally it’s quite unlike any other micropub I’ve ever been in, which on the whole tend to be very stripped back and basic. Here it looks very much like an old pub that’s been here for years and it’s difficult to believe that it’s a recent conversion. The landlord was very friendly and chatty and explained that the building had a suspended tiled ceiling when they bought it, and on removing that they found much water damage to the ceiling above necessitating some repair work, but they’ve even managed to make that look old rather than freshly plastered. Sanded wooden boards are on the floor, whilst the walls are predominantly dark green embossed wallpaper with a deep red on the ceiling. A large run covered much of the floor and the seating was mostly padded blue chairs along with a Chesterfield arm chair and an old sofa. A brick built bar counter was at the rear, and a chalk board next to this detailed the current selection. A piano was in one corner, and a few old black and white photographs were dotted around the walls.   

Beers on tap were Yeovil BST, Blindman’s Gambit, Pitchfork Bullion and Wadworth 6X. Cider’s meanwhile were Crossman’s, Thatcher’s Big Apple and a Rhubarb variety of unspecified origin. The Big Apple went down a treat, and I ended up staying for a couple. Unlike many micropubs, there is also a small selection of gins and wine, as well as a couple of Clark’s Pies on the food front. All in all, I thought this was a cracking pub, and I can see it being a regular stop whenever I’m in Weston." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
