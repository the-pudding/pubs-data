[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/25580/" title="Just to the west of Charles Holden\'s iconic Southgate tube station, this is a fairly typical 1996 shop conversion which was previously a Sainsbury\'s, the name taken from the former Crown, situated roughly opposite and demolished in the 1960s. There\'s a smoking area out front, though drinks can\'t be taken outside.
As mentioned, it\'s a deep room and with the small windows, suffers dearly from lack of light. Despite my visit on a very gloomy afternoon, I had to shield my eyes on leaving, such was the comparative glare of the grey sky.
Inside, and it\'s predictable with all dark wood, brass light fittings, high and low furniture, carpets, games\' machines and snooker on multiple TVs. The clients were quite mixed in age and gender, weren\'t as pickled as in some branches, but it was only lunchtime - not sure I\'d want to be in here late on a Friday or Saturday. The smell emanating from the lavs could have been addressed too.
Service was surprisingly enthusiastic with the barman even offering tasters, though Saturday lunchtime didn\'t prove to be that busy. There were ten pumps on offer delivering up amongst others Gloom, Abbot, the rather dreary Burton Bridge Brewery\'s Burton Ale, something from Wimbledon and seasonal Truman\'s Knees Up at a very decent £2.25 a pint and though not bad, I would probably get bored of it after a couple of pints.
Overall, this is what you\'d expect: cheap decent beer in an enviroment where empty tables are cluttered with empty glasses and plates, though there are though now only five pubs in the whole of N14." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/25580/" title="Just down the road from Southgate tube, and just about visible as you exit the station thanks to its impressive floral displays, this is a typical, mid-sized, open plan Wetherspoons on a busy retail street. Large folding doors along the front wall take you into a spacious carpeted room with the servery set along the right hand wall. The bar has a long, slightly off-straight counter and dark wood bar back with a row of high tables and stools directly opposite. Plenty more tables and chairs can be found to the front and further through the centre of the room, including a few positioned between some dark wood clad pillars with plain mirrors on them. Around much of the perimeter there are some unspeakably ugly upholstered banquettes, many of which have been formed into small booths, split by plain dark wood and glass partitioning screens. The walls throughout have been decorated with old portraits, local history boards and plain mirrors, so nothing much to get excited about. A few pavement seats might be nice for people watching and catching some rays, but who really wants to sit outside a Wetherspoons on a busy shopping street?
There are a total of ten handpulls on the bar, which had a good mix of ales, with four ‘Spoons regulars offset by no less than six guest ales. I tried a pint of the Goffs White Knight, served up by a really gruff barman who clearly didn’t want to be there. Fortunately the beer was in good shape and whilst I experienced the opposite with the food I ordered, which was subpar, yet served by a much friendlier waiter.
This place is another high street ‘Spoons without a great deal to make it stand out from the massed ranks of shop converted ‘Spoons across the country. Mixed experiences with the service and food were a little disappointing, but I left feeling that there was nothing inherently wrong with this place, which is a bit of an ale oasis in this part of London." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
