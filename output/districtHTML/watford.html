[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87343/" title="Watling Street Brewery relocated to the Greycaine Road Industrial Estate in 2018 in order to gain some more space. Around half of the unit is used for brewing and the other half is an interesting taproom. Basic furniture utilising scaffold poles, barrels and planks and a corrugated tin roof. There\'s an quirky pizza oven based in an old van parked in the corner. Regular open-mic, live music and comedy nights feature at weekends plus, at the current time, a weekly food market on Sunday afternoons. The beers on offer are mainly their own, but they do have an occasional guest. Last year they ran two very successful beer festivals with an additional 30 odd handpumps on a specially constructed bar in the brewery. It\'s located near to Watford North train Station (the Abbey Line from Watford Junction to St Albans Abbey). Not easy to spot as there is not much signage and the exterior looks a bit uninviting, but inside is a different story. A nice addition to Watford\'s poor real ale outlets." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
