[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/24329/" title="Just around the corner from Sydenham station, the Pavilion is a proper local’s pub with an old school, unpolished appeal to it. You enter into the front bar with an L-shaped servery opposite the front door and seating areas to either side. The right hand part of the room is formed into quite an intimate little space with nice banquette booths under the front windows and some limited dark wood panelling, giving it quite a traditional saloon bar feel. The left hand side has banquette and chair seating  with plush fixed benches down the end wall and to the rear. A couple of fireplaces here hint at the former multiple room layout and each has a plain mirror above and TV screens to the side. The window sills and shelves behind the benches are crammed full of well thumbed old paperbacks, whilst the walls have been painted in warm shades, with a few sheets of feature wallpaper blending in fairly well to the overall look. The servery has a white tongue and groove counter and basic, plain wood bar back, all presumably much altered as a result of various renovations and layout changes down the years. Decor throughout includes old black and white photos of the area in days gone by and some nostalgic old paintings of idyllic scenes. A door to the rear and another to the right of the servery lead you through into the back bar which is a simple L-shaped space with a pool table and dartboard to the rear, an unmanned bar to the left and a mix of high tables with stools and standard benches and chairs to pick from. A karaoke session was in full swing on my late night visit, taking up the front left corner of the pub and keeping most of the packed house entertained, creating quite a fun, rowdy atmosphere.
I didn’t expect to find any ale here, but they had two handpulls on the bar – one unused but the other dispensing Fullers London Pride at £3.40 a pint. I gave it a go and whilst it’s far from the best pint of Pride I’ve ever had, it was still in perfectly drinkable condition and served to me by a really friendly barman.
This place isn’t really the sort of pub that’s going to have people travelling from afar to visit, but it’s a pretty solid community boozer that seems to have a devoted following and is at least able to maintain one cask ale in decent condition. Not somewhere I’m likely to rush back to, but I at least I had a good time whilst I was there." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/24323/" title="A pub has stood on this site for around 300 years, or at least it had until 2012, when some unscrupulous property developers illegally demolished this place with the view of building new flats on the site. A local campaign and prosecution by the council helped to halt the development and forced the developers to rebuild the pub - a feat finally achieved in February 2018, six years after the place was knocked down and a full decade since it pulled its last pint. The new building is an impressive affair, replicating the pub\'s original design and layout, but presented in a high-spec, contemporary fashion. You enter past a patio seating area of dubious appeal due to its proximity to a busy roundabout, into the main bar area with the servery directly opposite along the rear wall. The bar has a nice traditional counter and well stocked bar back and has a series of high tables and stools arranged opposite, most of which were taken up by a large party during the course of our visit. the pub opens out to the left, where a spacious seating area, used more for diners in the evenings, can be found. This space is filled with regular tables and chairs and has a nice feature window at the far end which looks out towards the aforementioned roundabout and is good for a bit of people watching. The walls here have been decorated with a few nice old pictures including some of the pub in is pre-demolished state. Also of note are a few sections of original tiling which were thankfully salvaged from the only wall that wasn\'t initially knocked down, now appearing on the rebuilt front wall. The fixtures and fittings are all very smart and befitting a pub that perhaps leans a little towards the dining end of the spectrum, without really compromising too much on that crucial \'pubby\' feel.
There were four handpulls on the bar, all operational when we arrived, presenting us with a choice of Dark Star Hophead and American Pale Ale, Taylor Landlord and Adnams Old Ale. I tried the APA, which was in god shape and my father also enjoyed his pint of the Old Ale. The staff here were very friendly and helped us secure a table on a remarkably busy Saturday evening. We enjoyed a meal here to and whilst the proices are maybe a little steeper than you\'d expect for this part of town, we al enjoyed our dishes very much and had no real complaints.
This is a great story of a pub seemingly lost forever being resurrected at the cost of greedy developers and deserves to be well supported on those grounds alone. The pub presents itself well and whilst it may feel a little to food oriented for some, I still think you could settle down for a session here quite comfortably. A great addition to Sydenham\'s ailing pub scene and I look forward to a return visit sometime soon." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
