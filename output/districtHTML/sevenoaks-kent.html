[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/16793/" title="Very traditional pub, located less than 30 miles from central London but hidden away in rural Kent and accessed via twisting historic lanes barely wider than a car.  One of the locals reminded me that no so many years ago there were five pubs within walking distance of the hamlet of Basted, with this being the last survivor.  Although it was quiet in the plainly decorated \'L\'-shaped bar / dining area and on the front terrace when I arrived just after opening time, food is normally available and the trade supports three real ales from the four handpumps: Harvey\'s (£3.80, and in great shape), Larkin\'s Traditional and Tribute.  Not having been here for what must be at least 30 years, it was a pleasure to find it again." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
