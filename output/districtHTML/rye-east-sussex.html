[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/83178/" title="The Red Lion is a quirky 15th century country pub on Brede Hill Road opposite St George’s church, whose bells were ringing during a recent Saturday afternoon visit. To the left of the pub is a narrow entrance to a large car park at the rear that runs up the side of the long beer garden that is full of trees and bushes alongside an old greenhouse. The pub dog was very active in its patrol of the garden whilst collecting large sticks. There are three picnic tables outside the front of the pub that afford a nice view over the road to the church.
The bar area houses an L shaped serving counter to the left that offers a standard keg range alongside Amstel and San Miguel. I counted four handpumps that were all in use but only noted the presence of Greene King IPA and Harveys Best. The seating area towards the rear has sheet music wallpaper and is faced on the left by a large inglenook and houses a piano. On the walls and shelves are all manner of bric-a-brac. I didn’t spot a television and there was no background music playing. In the left-hand side of the pub is a separate seating area that I imagine is used by diners. The mains on the specials board were priced around £12 and the paninis for £7 come with chips.
There were only two other customers so there wasn’t much atmosphere, but I would bet that this different at busier times. I would pop back in here again if passing." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/11080/" title="This attractive old weatherboarded pub was transformed inside a few years ago into a curious yet quite appealing bar / café / bistro / delicatessen blend.  A counter-less servery now faces you as on entering, stacked with various breads, olives, nuts and spirits.  A compact lounge / dining  area lies to the left, a single large table occupies a space beside the main door and a larger dining room can be found down a single step to the right with a patio terrace beyond.  The five handpumps are initially far from obvious, but I found four real ales being served: the \'house\' (Tonbridge Brewery) Lookers Liquor (£3.90) and Hookers Hooch, the Skylarking session IPA from Pig & Porter and the ubiquitous Harvey\'s.  Up to six keg beers are dispensed from taps on the notional bar-back and five boxed ciders are also available.  With a relaxed atmosphere, this unusual place is worth a stop away from the touristy town centre." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
