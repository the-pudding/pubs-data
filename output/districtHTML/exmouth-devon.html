[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/7998/" title="Wonderful backstreet pub of the type almost of myth these days. Approach to an imposing Victorian building with the Home Nations flags fluttering outside. Enter to a large room with a high arch where presumably a divide once was (and would be beneficial to reinstate). There’s also a small rear overflow room. Pleasingly basic feel without being austere; worn herringbone flooring, green and cream walls, curtains. Covered pool table, darts and an upright piano. A rare 11am Sunday opener and at quarter past it was already getting busy with a nice locally atmosphere. Eight pumps with six on; 2x Dartmoor, Salcombe Storm Watch, Branoc and 2x Hanlons, Port Stout (NBSS 4) and Yellowhammer (4). Spoke to the landlady who has owned the place for 27 years and it shows. A real gem and worth a special trip to do." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

Surprised to see three ales on at the bar (Sharps Doom Bar, St Austell Tribute and Neep Tide) though normality was restored by the Neep Tide being over chilled to disguise it being faintly on the turn (NBSS 1.5). Points for the really friendly tattooed barmaid though, she ran the bar with chatty aplomb.  4.5" class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
