Popular canal side location with very scruffy tables outside. Could do with a good clean.

Inside, its wooden interior with a central bar and rather small. The bar is fiercely guarded by bar hoggers who obviously lost their space once, as they won\'t give up an inch.

Meant it was tricky for me to fully review the beers on handpull. I didn\'t recognise any of the pump clips but always prepared to try - if only I could have seen what was on offer.

Instead, and as it was a red hot day - I went for a Camden Hells Lager - served in a unique glass from the brewery.

Would certainly revisit...." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
