[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/78798/" title="A fitting name to what was once a thriving watchmakers town. Once through the main doors, you will see a semi circular clock face depicted in the flooring. A large wall mounted pocket watch, displaying a moving mechanism, which was commissioned by Wetherspoons can be found on the left of the entrance. Other various clock themed features included lampshades with dials and glass partition screens depicting watch parts. The bar was situated down the left hand side and had a choice of eight hand pulled ales. I went for the Big Bog Welsh Pale Ale, which was in excellent condition and only £2.05 a pint." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

Five ales on handpump and two ciders on our Tuesday evening visit, I went for the Cheshire Brewhouse Rockall DDH Oatmeal Pale, an excellent beer at £3 a pint. The barman was very friendly and chatty and the pub had a relaxed atmosphere, a true haven to enjoy some good beers.
