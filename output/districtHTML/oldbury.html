[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/38477/" title="An impressive looking pub, built in 1900 by Holt\'s Brewery. The main features in here was the elaborate use of internal tiling, with the side corridor displaying a show case of wall and floor tiling. Further cream coloured wall tiling can also be found in the front bar, along with the original mahogany counter and ornate back bar. The pub was busy with locals on our Friday eve visit, so we took our drinks to the back room, or smoke room back in the day. This room had mustard coloured painted walls, bare floorboards, high back upholstered banquette seating with the original push bells, positioned along highly polished mahogany panelling. The marble fireplace was the main feature in here and some stained glass in the upper parts of the large window can also be noticed. The main bar had five pumps with beers from Backyard, Enville and AJ\'s. So we went for the AJ\'s In the Doghouse. All their cask beers were priced at £2.80 a pint." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
