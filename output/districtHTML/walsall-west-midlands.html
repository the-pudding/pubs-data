[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/38903/" title="I had been looking forward to visiting this iconic pub since reading about it in Camra\'s book of Real Heritage Pubs of the Midlands, and Luton Town\'s game at the Bescot Stadium gave me the opportunity. It\'s a 19th century building that was remodelled in the 1920s, which was when the glazed tile front would have been added, and the interior has remained largely unchanged since. There are 10 hand pumps around the central servery, with two real ciders and eight real ales all listed on a blackboard for ease of reference. There\'s an enthusiasm for real ale which, as BF says below, deserves a longer visit than my pre-football schedule would allow.
