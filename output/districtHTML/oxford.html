[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/87425/" title="A chain cocktail bar located on the \'Rooftop Terrace\' of Oxford\'s new Westgate Centre. Heaving with pretty young things on a Saturday afternoon, there were two keg pumps serving unbranded fizz.

There is a small wooden floored bar section as you enter through the very pleasant outside courtyard garden area with a nice stone fireplace and some limited leather settee seating, but most people visit here to eat in the stone flagged restaurant rooms beyond the bar.
There are two hand pumps on the bar with Hook Norton Hooky seemingly a permanent feature and for our visit a local beer in the form of Abingdon Bridge from the Loose Cannon Brewery in said nearby town.
Having walked here across the fields from The Seven Stars in Marsh Baldon I was ready for a beer and the Abingdon Bridge went down well enough as we enjoyed the garden section on a sunny day.
We cannot comment on the food, but I do believe the patron referred to in the review below is still in situ, and I am sure as a gastro restaurant it probably warrants a 10 and several people on trip advisor reviewing the Mole Inn as a restaurant seem to tend to agree. But as a pub just for a beer its not really that great an experience you would want to get from a country pub and I would certainly put the Seven Stars over this one for that experience." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
