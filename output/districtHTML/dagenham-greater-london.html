[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/11767/" title="You enter this pub via a small corridor; we went straight into the room on the right where we could see people and could hear activity. This room is totally modernised and has had all of its traditional pub character knocked out of it. There\'s also a conservatory in this part of the pub. They did have Hobgoblin Gold on though, at a very reasonable £3 a pint. There were blackboard signs advertising food, but there were no menus in evidence during our visit at around 6.0 PM on a Wednesday. There\'s a pool table in here, as well as a fish tank, and it\'s reasonably comfortably furnished. But the heavy metal \"music\" blaring out at deafening levels was very offputting.

What we should have done is turn left on entering the entrance corridor, which has a separate door into the saloon bar. There was no-one in here, so I guess most visitors prefer the noise of the main bar. But there was no music in the saloon bar, which was carpeted and comfortably furnished with normal tables and chairs. It had the look of a room that wasn\'t supposed to be open. It also had what looks like the original bar counter, and perhaps the original bar back as well. This is definitely a pub of two halves. I liked the saloon bar but hated the main bar; but in any case I\'m not likely to visit again." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/83622/" title="This one did had a single real ale on - Doom Bar of course, which was at a very reasonable £3.39 a pint, but was in poor condition, even by Doom Bar standards. Basic pub grub food seems to be its forte, with glossy menus on the tables and the usual sort of meal deals, including selected main courses (e.g. fish & chips) at £8.99 for two. That\'s fine if there are two of you, but not much use if you\'re on your own where most main courses are around the same price as for two of the selected meals.

It looks very much like a hotel bar and restaurant, which is not surprising as it\'s effectively the restaurant for the Premier Inn next door. All the paraphernalia for buffet breakfasts were still around, such as a bank of coffee machines, toast machines and fruit juice dispensers, but of course not in use at lunchtime. They had something else here which I\'ve not seen in a pub before - a rotating glass cabinet ib the centre of the room displaying the available desserts. There\'s garden at the side as well. 

This is an anonymous formulaic pub. But it came in handy when my chum and I were looking for a bite to eat on our travels. However there\'s no real reason for any pub enthusiast to visit." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
