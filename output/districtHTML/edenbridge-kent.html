[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/16011/" title="Westerham Brewery pub located part-way up the Greensand Ridge, but a welcome stopping point on a long walk (and thankfully I arrived just before the mid-afternoon closure, even on a Saturday).  Partly opened-out inside, with a staple-shaped bar area (one end of which has an interesting moulded sign above a disused fireplace) and a dining area off to one side.  Surprisingly, none of their own beers were available on a total of five handpumps (although a reversed Spirit of Kent clip could be seen), just London Pride and the local(ish) Larkin\'s Traditional (£3.60).  Extra point for the friendly barman." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>

[<a rel="nofollow" href="/pubs/59046/" title="A rambling,timber framed and tile hung late medieval building in the picture postcard National Trust owned village of Chiddingstone in West Kent. I’d driven past this pub earlier in the year, and had book marked it for a family outing. I was vaguely worried that it would be gastro and  “up itself” having looked at the website, and discovered that it belongs, as does the rest of the village, to the Trust. However, on arrival on a perfect early September  Saturday lunchtime, with the family, I was reassured to find a remarkable black and red tiled floor in the public bar, and no signs of fuss.
We sat in the empty saloon bar : a noisy wedding party drifted in and out of the public, and a good number of walkers were in the garden behind the pub.Our meals were reasonably priced for West Kent-not far from Surrey!, and charmingly served. I’d known that this was the de facto brewery tap for Larkins’ Brewery just up the lane, and was pleased to find their Traditional and Best Bitters on the bar, alongside the deservedly ubiquitous Harvey’s Sussex Best Bitter. The Trad was as delightful as ever,but the Best, a beer that I’d not tried before was perfect, a classic ,subtle drink that could only come from England, and probably Kent.
This is one of a select number of pubs  that really seem to connect with their community.Others include The Blacksmiths at Lastingham and the Strathmore Arms, both in Yorkshire,and the Red Lion at Snargate.
After doing touristy things in Westerham, we came back in the dusk like bats, and enjoyed more beer and banter sitting at the benches in front, by the closed gates to the Castle.
8th.September 2019:Update.This pub closed in 2015 or \'16 for major structural repairs.It reopened in 2017,under the management of a local pub,and the current managers took it on in April 2019,though I understand that the building belongs to the National Trust, along with much of the village.The lay out is much the same as before,with upgraded kitchen and loos.On our visit in September 2019,Larkins Traditional(in good nick),was joined by Titsey Brewing\'s Gresham Hopper(dull).Larkins Pale was unavailable. A somewhat corporate atmosphere,I\'m afraid to say." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
