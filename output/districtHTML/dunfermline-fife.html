Even on a quiet and very cold evening there were a few drinkers dotted about the large ground floor. The bar is on the left, and featured the usual \'Spoons beer offering, of which only one was from a Scottish brewery: Inveralmond. Other \"guests\" at the time of my visit were from Upham, Dark Star and Roosters.
