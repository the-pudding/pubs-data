Doombar is my choice of ale and served very well. Lots of screens for sport lovers. No food served but you can bring in your own. Problem is, no notice of opening times displayed, so have been in the area and had to walk past closed doors.
Update: Went in there on Bank Holiday Monday. Doombar still on sale, but now costs £5 a pint and it was served in plastic. Think I\'ll miss this pub from now on. Rating gone down." class="reviewext">more&gt;</a>]</p>
